from Edward Irving, then a young man
“fresh from Edinburgh, with college prizes, &amp;c.”—“come
to see our schoolmaster, who had also been
his.” From this place, they say, you can look over
into Wordsworth’s country. Here first he may have
become acquainted with Nature, with woods, such as
are there, and rivers and brooks, some of whose
names we have heard, and the last lapses of Atlantic
billows. He got some of his education, too, more or
less liberal, out of the University of Edinburgh,
where, according to the same authority, he had to
“support himself,” partly by “private tuition, translations
for the booksellers, &amp;c.,” and afterward, as
we are glad to hear, “taught an academy in Dysart,
at the same time that Irving was teaching in Kirkaldy,”
the usual middle passage of a literary life.
He was destined for the church, but not by the
powers that rule man’s life; made his literary début
in Fraser’s Magazine, long ago; read here and
there in English and French, with more or less
profit, we may suppose, such of us at least as are
not particularly informed, and at length found some
words which spoke to his condition in the German
language, and set himself earnestly to unravel that
mystery—with what success many readers know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his marriage he “resided partly at Comely
Bank, Edinburgh; and for a year or two at Craigenputtock,
a wild and solitary farm-house in the upper
part of Dumfriesshire,” at which last place, amid
barren heather hills, he was visited by our countryman
Emerson. With Emerson he still corresponds.
He was early intimate with Edward Irving, and
continued to be his friend until the latter’s death.
Concerning this “freest, brotherliest, bravest human
soul,” and Carlyle’s relation to him, those
whom it concerns will do well to consult a notice
of his death in Fraser’s Magazine for 1835, reprinted
in the Miscellanies. He also corresponded with
Goethe. Latterly, we hear, the poet Stirling was
his only intimate acquaintance in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has spent the last quarter of his life in London,
writing books; has the fame, as all readers know,
of having made England acquainted with Germany,
in late years, and done much else that is novel and
remarkable in literature. He especially is the literary
man of those parts. You may imagine him
living in altogether a retired and simple way, with
small family, in a quiet part of London, called Chelsea,
a little out of the din of commerce, in “Cheyne
Row,” there, not far from the “Chelsea Hospital.”
“A little past this, and an old ivy-clad church, with
its buried generations lying around it,” writes one
traveler, “you come to an antique street running at
right angles with the Thames, and, a few steps from
the river, you find Carlyle’s name on the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Scotch lass ushers you into the second story
front chamber, which is the spacious <a id='work'></a>workshop of
the world maker.” Here he sits a long time together,
with many books and papers about him;
many new books, we have been told, on the upper
shelves, uncut, with the “author’s respects” in
them; in late months, with many manuscripts in an
old English hand, and innumerable pamphlets, from
the public libraries, relating to the Cromwellian
period; now, perhaps, looking out into the street
on brick and pavement, for a change, and now upon
some rod of grass ground in the rear; or, perchance,
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
he steps over to the British Museum, and makes
that his studio for the time. This is the fore part of
the day; that is the way with literary men commonly;
and then in the afternoon, we presume, he
takes a short run of a mile or so through the suburbs
out into the country; we think he would run that
way, though so short a trip might not take him to
very sylvan or rustic places. In the meanwhile,
people are calling to <span class='it'>see</span> him, from various quarters,
very few worthy of being <span class='it'>seen</span> by him, “distinguished
travelers from America,” not a few, to all and sundry
of whom he gives freely of his yet unwritten
rich and flashing soliloquy, in exchange for whatever
they may have to offer; speaking his English,
as they say, with a “broad Scotch accent,” talking,
to their astonishment and to ours, very much as he
writes, a sort of Carlylese, his discourse “coming to
its climaxes, ever and anon, in long, deep, chest-shaking
bursts of laughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He goes to Scotland sometimes to visit his native
heath-clad hills, having some interest still in the
earth there; such names as Craigenputtock and
Ecclefechan, which we have already quoted, stand
for habitable places there to him; or he rides to the
seacoast of England in his vacations, upon his horse
Yankee, bought by the sale of his books here, as we
have been told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, after all, he gets his living; what proportion
of his daily bread he earns by day-labor or job-work
with his pen, what he inherits, what steals—questions
whose answers are so significant, and not to
be omitted in his biography—we, alas! are unable
to answer here. It may be worth the while to state
that he is not a Reformer, in our sense of the term,
eats, drinks, and sleeps, thinks and believes, professes
and practices, not according to the New
England standard, nor to the Old English wholly.
Nevertheless, we are told that he is a sort of lion
in certain quarters there, “an amicable centre for
men of the most opposite opinions,” and “listened
to as an oracle,” “smoking his perpetual pipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rather tall, gaunt figure, with intent face, dark
hair and complexion, and the air of a student; not
altogether well in body, from sitting too long in his
workhouse, he, born in the border country and descended
from moss-troopers, it may be. We have
seen several pictures of him here; one, a full length
portrait, with hat and overall, if it did not tell us
much, told the fewest lies; another, we remember,
was well said to have “too combed a look;” one
other also we have seen in which we discern some
features of the man we are thinking of; but the
only ones worth remembering, after all, are those
which he has unconsciously drawn of himself.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>When we remember how these volumes came
over to us, with their encouragement and provocation
from mouth to mouth, and what commotion
they created in many private breasts, we wonder
that the country did not ring, from shore to shore,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with its greeting;
and the Boons and Crockets of the West make haste
to hail him, whose wide humanity embraces them
too. Of all that the packets have brought over to
us, has there been any richer cargo than this? What
else has been English news for so long a season?
What else, of late years, has been England to us—to
us who read books, we mean? Unless we remembered
it as the scene where the age of Wordsworth
was spending itself, and a few younger muses
were trying their wings, and from time to time, as
the residence of Landon; Carlyle alone, since the
death of Coleridge, has kept the promise of England.
It is the best apology for all the bustle and the sin
of commerce, that it has made us acquainted with
the thoughts of this man. Commerce would not
concern us much if it were not for such results as
this. New England owes him a debt which she will
be slow to recognize. His earlier essays reached
us at a time when Coleridge’s were the only recent
words which had made any notable impression so
far, and they found a field unoccupied by him, before
yet any words of moment had been uttered in
our midst. He had this advantage, too, in a teacher,
that he stood near to his pupils; and he has no doubt
afforded reasonable encouragement and sympathy
to many an independent but solitary thinker.
Through him, as usher, we have been latterly, in a
great measure, made acquainted with what philosophy
and criticism the nineteenth century had to
offer—admitted, so to speak, to the privileges of the
century; and what he may yet have to say, is still
expected here with more interest than any thing else
from that quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is remarkable, but on the whole, perhaps, not to
be lamented, that the world is so unkind to a new
book. Any distinguished traveler who comes to
our shores, is likely to get more dinners and speeches
of welcome than he can well dispose of, but the
best books, if noticed at all, meet with coldness and
suspicion, or, what is worse, gratuitous, off-hand
criticism. It is plain that the reviewers, both here
and abroad, do not know how to dispose of this
man. They approach him too easily, as if he were
one of the men of letters about town, who grace
Mr. Somebody’s administration, merely; but he
already belongs to literature, and depends neither
on the favor of reviewers, nor the honesty of book-sellers,
nor the pleasure of readers for his success.
He has more to impart than to receive from his
generation. He is another such a strong and
finished workman in his craft as Samuel Johnson
was, and like him, makes the literary class respectable.
As few are yet out of their apprenticeship,
or even if they learn to be able writers, are at the
same time able and valuable thinkers. The aged
and critical <a id='eye'></a>eye, especially, is incapacitated to
appreciate the works of this author. To such their
meaning is impalpable and evanescent, and they
seem to abound only in obstinate mannerisms,
Germanisms, and whimsical ravings of all kinds,
with now and then an unaccountably true and
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
sensible remark. On the strength of this last, Carlyle
is admitted to have what is called genius.
We hardly know an old man to whom these
volumes are not hopelessly sealed. The language,
they say, is foolishness and a stumbling-block to them;
but to many a clear-headed boy, they are plainest
English, and despatched with such hasty relish as
his bread and milk. The fathers wonder how it is
that the children take to this diet so readily, and
digest it with so little difficulty. They shake their
heads with mistrust at their free and easy delight,
and remark that “Mr. Carlyle is a very learned
man;” for they, too, not to be out of fashion, have
got grammar and dictionary, if the truth were known,
and with the best faith cudgelled their brains to get
a little way into the jungle, and they could not but
confess, as often as they found the clue, that it was
as intricate as Blackstone to follow, if you read it
honestly. But merely reading, even with the best
intentions, is not enough, you must almost have
written these books yourself. Only he who has had
the good fortune to read them in the nick of time,
in the most perceptive and recipient season of life,
can give any adequate account of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many have tasted of this well with an odd suspicion,
as if it were some fountain Arethuse which
had flowed under the sea from Germany, as if the
materials of his books had lain in some garret there,
in danger of being appropriated for waste paper.
Over what German ocean, from what Hercynian
forest, he has been imported, piece-meal, into England,
or whether he has now all arrived, we are not
informed. This article is not invoiced in Hamburg,
nor in London. Perhaps it was contraband.
However, we suspect that this sort of goods cannot
be imported in this way. No matter how skillful
the stevedore, all things being got into sailing trim,
wait for a Sunday, and aft wind, and then weigh
anchor, and run up the main-sheet—straightway
what of transcendant and permanent value is
there resists the aft wind, and will doggedly
stay behind that Sunday—it does not travel Sundays;
while biscuit and pork make headway, and
sailors cry heave-yo! it must part company, if it
open a seam. It is not quite safe to send out a
venture in this kind, unless yourself go supercargo.
Where a man goes, there he is; but the slightest
virtue is immovable—it is real estate, not personal;
who would keep it, must consent to be bought and
sold with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, we need not dwell on this charge of a
German extraction, it being generally admitted, by
this time, that Carlyle is English, and an inhabitant
of London. He has the English for his mother
tongue, though with a Scotch accent, or never so
many accents, and thoughts also, which are the
legitimate growth of native soil, to utter therewith.
His style is eminently colloquial—and no wonder it
is strange to meet with in a book. It is not literary
or classical; it has not the music of poetry, nor the
pomp of philosophy, but the rhythms and cadences
of conversation endlessly repeated. It resounds
with emphatic, natural, lively, stirring tones, muttering,
rattling, exploding, like shells and shot, and
with like execution. So far as it is a merit in composition,
that the written answer to the spoken
word, and the spoken word to a fresh and pertinent
thought in the mind, as well as to the half thoughts,
the tumultuary misgivings and expectancies, this
author is, perhaps, not to be matched in literature.
In the streets men laugh and cry, but in books,
never; they “whine, put finger i’ the eye, and
sob” only. One would think that all books of late,
had adopted the felling inflexion. “A mother, if she
wishes to sing her child to sleep,” say the musical
men, “will always adopt the falling inflexion.”
Would they but choose the rising inflexion, and
wake the child up for once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is no mystic either, more than Newton or Arkwright,
or Davy—and tolerates none. Not one obscure
line, or half line, did he ever write. His
meaning lies plain as the daylight, and he who runs
may read; indeed, only he who runs <span class='it'>can</span> read, and
keep up with the meaning. It has the distinctness
of picture to his mind, and he tells us only what he
sees printed in largest English type upon the face of
things. He utters substantial English thoughts in
plainest English dialects; for it must be confessed,
he speaks more than one of these. All the shires of
England, and all the shires of Europe, are laid under
contribution to his genius; for to be English does
not mean to be exclusive and narrow, and adapt
one’s self to the apprehension of his nearest neighbor
only. And yet no writer is more thoroughly Saxon.
In the translation of those fragments of Saxon
poetry, we have met with the same rhythm that
occurs so often in his poem on the French Revolution.
And if you would know where many of
those obnoxious Carlyleisms and Germanisms came
from, read the best of Milton’s prose, read those
speeches of Cromwell which he has brought to
light, or go and listen once more to your mother’s
tongue. So much for his German extraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, for fluency and skill in the use of the
English tongue, he is a master unrivaled. His
felicity and power of expression surpass even any
of his special merits as a historian and critic.
Therein his experience has not failed him, but
furnished him with such a store of winged, aye,
and legged words, as only a London life, perchance,
could give account of; we had not understood the
wealth of the language before. Nature is ransacked,
and all the resorts and purlieus of humanity are
taxed, to furnish the fittest symbol for his thought.
He does not go to the dictionary, the word-book, but
to the word-manufactory itself, and has made endless
work for the lexicographers—yes, he has that
same English for his mother-tongue, that you have,
but with him it is no dumb, muttering, mumbling
faculty, concealing the thoughts, but a keen, unwearied,
resistless weapon. He has such command
of it as neither you nor I have; and it would
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
be well for any who have a lost horse to advertise,
or a town-meeting warrant, or a sermon, or a letter
to write, to study this universal letter-writer, for he
knows more than the grammar or the dictionary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style is worth attending to, as one of the
most important features of the man which we at this
distance can discern. It is for once quite equal to
the matter. It can carry all its load, and never
breaks down nor staggers. His books are solid and
workmanlike, as all that England does; and they
are graceful and readable also. They tell of huge
labor done, well done, and all the rubbish swept
away, like the bright cutlery which glitters in shop-windows,
while the coke and ashes, the turnings,
filings, dust, and borings, lie far away at Birmingham,
unheard of. He is a masterly clerk, scribe, reporter,
and writer. He can reduce to writing most
things—gestures, winks, nods, significant looks,
patois, brogue, accent, pantomime, and how much
that had passed for silence before, does he represent
by written words. The countryman who puzzled
the city lawyer, requiring him to write, among
other things, his call to his horses, would hardly
have puzzled him; he would have found a word for
it, all right and classical, that would have started his
team for him. Consider the ceaseless tide of speech
forever flowing in countless cellars, garrets, <span class='it'>parlors</span>;
that of the French, says Carlyle, “only ebbs toward
the short hours of night,” and what a drop in the
bucket is the printed word. Feeling, thought,
speech, writing, and we might add, poetry, inspiration—for
so the circle is completed; how they gradually
dwindle at length, passing through successive
colanders, into your history and classics, from the
roar of the ocean, the murmur of the forest, to the
squeak of a mouse; so much only parsed and spelt
out, and punctuated, at last. The few who can talk
like a book, they only get reported commonly.
But this writer reports a new “Lieferung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One wonders how so much, after all, was expressed
in the old way, so much here depends upon
the emphasis, tone, pronunciation, style, and spirit
of the reading. No writer uses so profusely all the
aids to intelligibility which the printer’s art affords.
You wonder how others had contrived to write so
many pages without emphatic or italicised words,
they are so expressive, so natural, so indispensable
here, as if none had ever used the demonstrative
pronouns demonstratively before. In another’s sentences
the thought, though it may be immortal, is, as
it were, embalmed, and does not <span class='it'>strike</span> you, but here
it is so freshly living, even the body of it, not having
passed through the ordeal of death, that it stirs in
the very extremities, and the smallest particles and
pronouns are all alive with it. It is not simple dictionary
<span class='it'>it</span>, yours or mine, but <span style='font-size:smaller'>IT</span>. The words did
not come at the command of grammar, but of a
tyrannous, inexorable meaning; not like standing
soldiers, by vote of parliament, but any able-bodied
countryman pressed into the service, for “sire, it is
not a revolt, it is a revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have never heard him speak, but we should
say that Carlyle was a rare talker. He has broken
the ice, and streams freely forth like a spring torrent.
He does not trace back the stream of his thought,
silently adventurous, up to its fountain-head, but is
borne away with it, as it rushes through his brain
like a torrent to overwhelm and fertilize. He
holds a talk with you. His audience is such a
tumultuous mob of thirty thousand, as assembled
at the University of Paris, before printing was invented.
Philosophy, on the other hand, does not
talk, but write, or, when it comes personally before
an audience, lecture or read; and therefore it must
be read to-morrow, or a thousand years hence. But
the talker must naturally be attended to at once; he
does not talk on without an audience; the winds do
not long bear the sound of his voice. Think of
Carlyle reading his French Revolution to any
audience. One might say it was never written,
but spoken; and thereafter reported and printed,
that those not within sound of his voice might know
something about it. Some men read to you something
which they have written, in a dead <span class='it'>language</span>,
of course, but it may be in a living <span class='it'>letter</span>, in a Syriac,
or Roman, or Runic character. Men must <span class='it'>speak</span>
English who can <span class='it'>write</span> Sanscrit; and they must speak
a modern language who write, perchance, an ancient
and universal one. We do not live in those
days when the learned used a learned language.
There is no writing of Latin with Carlyle, but as
Chaucer, with all reverence to Homer, and Virgil,
and Messieurs the Normans, sung his poetry in the
homely Saxon tongue; and Locke has at least the
merit of having done philosophy into English—so
Carlyle has done a different philosophy still further
into English, and thrown open the doors of literature
and criticism to the populace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a style—so diversified and variegated! It
is like the face of a country; it is like a New England
landscape, with farm-houses and villages, and
cultivated spots, and belts of forests and blueberry-swamps
round about it, with the fragrance of shad-blossoms
and violets on certain winds. And as for
the reading of it, it is novel enough to the reader
who has used only the diligence, and old-line mail-coach.
It is like traveling, sometimes on foot, sometimes
in a gig tandem; sometimes in a full coach,
over highways, mended and unmended, for which
you will prosecute the town; on level roads, through
French departments, by Simplon roads over the
Alps, and now and then he hauls up for a relay, and
yokes in an unbroken colt of a Pegasus for a leader,
driving off by cart-paths, and across lots, by corduroy
roads and gridiron bridges; and where the bridges
are gone, not even a string-piece left, and the reader
has to set his breast and swim. You have got an
expert driver this time, who has driven ten thousand
miles, and was never known to upset; can
drive six in hand on the edge of a precipice, and
touch the leaders anywhere with his snapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With wonderful art he grinds into paint for his
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
picture all his moods and experiences, so that all his
forces may be brought to the encounter. Apparently
writing without a particular design or responsibility,
setting down his soliloquies from time
to time, taking advantage of all his humors, when
at length the hour comes to declare himself, he
puts down in plain English, without quotation marks,
what he, Thomas Carlyle, is ready to defend in the
face of the world, and fathers the rest, often quite
as defensible, only more modest, or plain spoken,
or insinuating, upon “Sauerteig,” or some other
gentleman long employed on the subject. Rolling
his subject how many ways in his mind, he meets it
now face to face, wrestling with it at arm’s length,
and striving to get it down, or throws it over his
head; and if that will not do, or whether it will do
or not, tries the back-stitch and side-hug with it, and
downs it again—scalps it, draws and quarters it,
hangs it in chains, and leaves it to the winds and
dogs. With his brows knit, his mind made up, his
will resolved and resistless, he advances, crashing
his way through the host of weak, half-formed,
<span class='it'>dilettante</span> opinions, honest and dishonest ways of
thinking, with their standards raised, sentimentalities
and conjectures, and tramples them all into
dust. See how he prevails; you don’t even hear
the groans of the wounded and dying. Certainly it
is not so well worth the while to look through any
man’s eyes at history, for the time, as through his;
and his way of looking at things is fastest getting
adopted by his generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not in man to determine what his style shall
be. He might as well determine what his thoughts
shall be. We would not have had him write always
as in the chapter on Burns, and the Life of Schiller,
and elsewhere. No; his thoughts were ever
irregular and impetuous. Perhaps as he grows older
and writes more he acquires a truer expression; it
is in some respects manlier, freer, struggling up to
a level with its fountain-head. We think it is the
richest prose style we know of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who cares what a man’s style is, so it is intelligible—as
intelligible as his thought. Literally
and really, the style is no more than the <span class='it'>stylus</span>, the
pen he writes with—and it is not worth scraping
and polishing, and gilding, unless it will write his
thoughts the better for it. It is something for use,
and not to look at. The question for us is not
whether Pope had a fine style, wrote with a peacock’s
feather, but whether he uttered useful
thoughts. Translate a book a dozen times from one
language to another, and what becomes of its style?
Most books would be worn out and disappear in
this ordeal. The pen which wrote it is soon destroyed,
but the poem survives. We believe that
Carlyle has, after all, more readers, and is better
known to-day for this very originality of style, and
that posterity will have reason to thank him for
emancipating the language, in some measure, from
the fetters which a merely conservative, aimless,
and pedantic literary class had imposed upon it, and
setting an example of greater freedom and naturalness.
No man’s thoughts are new, but the style of
their expression is the never failing novelty which
cheers and refreshes men. If we were to answer
the question, whether the mass of men, as we know
them, talk as the standard authors and reviewers
write, or rather as this man writes, we should say
that he alone begins to write their language at all,
and that the former is, for the most part, the mere
effigies of a language, not the best method of concealing
one’s thoughts even, but frequently a method
of doing without thoughts at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his graphic description of Richter’s style,
Carlyle describes his own pretty nearly; and no
doubt he first got his own tongue loosened at that
fountain, and was inspired by it to equal freedom
and originality. “The language,” as he says of
Richter, “groans with indescribable metaphors and
allusions to all things, human and divine, flowing
onward, not like a river, but like an inundation;
circling in complex eddies, chafing and gurgling,
now this way, now that;” but in Carlyle, “the
proper current” never “sinks out of sight amid the
boundless uproar.” Again: “His very language is
Titanian—deep, strong, tumultuous, shining with a
thousand hues, fused from a thousand elements, and
winding in labyrinthic mazes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, if it is desirable that a man be eloquent,
that he talk much, and address himself to his own
age mainly, then this is not a bad style of doing it.
But if it is desired rather that he pioneer into unexplored
regions of thought, and speaks to silent
centuries to come, then, indeed, we could wish that
he had cultivated the style of Goethe more, that of
Richter less; not that Goethe’s is the kind of utterance
most to be prized by mankind, but it will serve
for a model of the best that can be successfully
cultivated.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>But for style, and fine writing, and Augustan
ages—that is but a poor style, and vulgar writing,
and a degenerate age, which allows us to remember
these things. This man has something to communicate.
Carlyle’s are not, in the common sense,
works of art in their origin and aim; and yet, perhaps,
no living English writer evinces an equal
literary talent. They are such works of art only
as the plough, and corn-mill, and steam-engine—not
as pictures and statues. Others speak with greater
emphasis to scholars, as such, but none so earnestly
and effectually to all who can read. Others give
their advice, he gives his sympathy also. It is no
small praise that he does not take upon himself the
airs, has none of the whims, none of the pride, the
nice vulgarities, the starched, impoverished isolation,
and cold glitter of the spoiled children of genius.
He does not need to husband his pearl, but excels
by a greater humanity and sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is singularly serious and untrivial. We are
every where impressed by the rugged, unwearied,
and rich sincerity of the man. We are sure that he
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
never sacrificed one jot of his honest thought to art
or whim, but to utter himself in the most direct and
effectual way, that is the endeavor. These are
merits which will wear well. When time has
worn deeper into the substance of these books, this
grain will appear. No such sermons have come
to us here out of England, in late years, as those of
this preacher; sermons to kings, and sermons to
peasants, and sermons to all intermediate classes.
It is in vain that John Bull, or any of his cousins,
turns a deaf ear, and pretends not to hear them,
nature will not soon be weary of repeating them.
There are words less obviously true, more for the
ages to hear, perhaps, but none so impossible for
this age not to hear. What a cutting cimiter was
that “past and present,” going through heaps of
silken stuffs, and glibly through the necks of men,
too, without their knowing it, leaving no trace. He
has the earnestness of a prophet. In an age of
pedantry and dilettantism, he has no grain of these
in his composition. There is no where else, surely,
in recent readable English, or other books, such
direct and effectual teaching, reproving, encouraging,
stimulating, earnestly, vehemently, almost like
Mahomet, like Luther; not looking behind him to
see how his <span class='it'>Opera Omnia</span> will look, but forward to
other work to be done. His writings are a gospel
to the young of this generation; they will hear his
manly, brotherly speech with responsive joy, and
press forward to older or newer gospels.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>We should omit a main attraction in these books,
if we said nothing of their humor. Of this indispensable
pledge of sanity, without some leaven, of which
the abstruse thinker may justly be suspected of
mysticism, fanaticism, or insanity, there is a super-abundance
in Carlyle. Especially the transcendental
philosophy needs the leaven of humor to render
it light and digestible. In his later and longer works
it is an unfailing accompaniment, reverberating
through pages and chapters, long sustained without
effort. The very punctuation, the italics, the quotation
marks, the blank spaces and dashes, and the
capitals, each and all are pressed into its service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every man, of course, has his fane, from which
even the most innocent conscious humor is excluded;
but in proportion as the writer’s position is
high above his fellows, the range of his humor is
extended. To the thinker, all the institutions of men,
as all imperfection, viewed from the point of equanimity,
are legitimate subjects of humor. Whatever
is not necessary, no matter how sad or personal, or
universal a grievance, is, indeed, a jest more or less
sublime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carlyle’s humor is vigorous and Titanic, and has
more sense in it than the sober philosophy of many
another. It is not to be disposed of by laughter and
smiles merely; it gets to be too serious for that—only
they may laugh who are not hit by it. For
those who love a merry jest, this is a strange
kind of fun—rather too practical joking, if they
understand it. The pleasant humor which the
public loves, is but the innocent pranks of the ball-room,
harmless flow of animal spirits, the light
plushy pressure of dandy pumps, in comparison.
But when an elephant takes to treading on your
corns, why then you are lucky if you sit high, or
wear cowhide. His humor is always subordinate to
a serious purpose, though often the real charm for
the reader, is not so much in the essential progress
and final upshot of the chapter, as in this indirect side-light
illustration of every hue. He sketches first
with strong, practical English pencil, the essential
features in outline, black on white, more faithfully
than Dryasdust would have done, telling us wisely
whom and what to mark, to save time, and then
with brush of camel’s hair, or sometimes with more
expeditious swab, he lays on the bright and fast
colors of his humor everywhere. One piece of
solid work, be it known, we have determined to do,
about which let there be no jesting, but all things
else under the heavens, to the right and left of that,
are for the time fair game. To us this humor is not
wearisome, as almost every other is. Rabelais, for
instance, is intolerable; one chapter is better than a
volume—it may be sport to him, but it is death to
us. A mere humorist, indeed, is a most unhappy
man; and his readers are most unhappy also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Humor is not so distinct a quality as for the purposes
of criticism, it is commonly regarded, but
allied to every, even the divinest faculty. The
familiar and cheerful conversation about every
hearth-side, if it be analyzed, will be found to be
sweetened by this principle. There is not only a
never-failing, pleasant, and earnest humor kept up
there, embracing the domestic affairs, the dinner,
and the scolding, but there is also a constant run
upon the neighbors, and upon church and state, and
to cherish and maintain this, in a great measure,
the fire is kept burning, and the dinner provided.
There will be neighbors, parties to a very genuine,
even romantic friendship, whose whole audible
salutation and intercourse, abstaining from the
usual cordial expressions, grasping of hands, or
affectionate farewells, consists in the mutual play
and interchange of a genial and healthy humor,
which excepts nothing, not even themselves, in its
lawless range. The child plays continually, if you
will let it, and all its life is a sort of practical humor
of a very pure kind, often of so fine and ethereal a
nature, that its parents, its uncles and cousins, can
in no wise participate in it, but must stand aloof in
silent admiration, and reverence even. The more
quiet the more profound it is. Even nature is observed
to have her playful moods or aspects, of
which man seems sometimes to be the sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after all, we could sometimes dispense with
the humor, though unquestionably incorporated in
the blood, if it were replaced by this author’s gravity.
We should not apply to himself, without qualification,
his remarks on the humor of Richter. With
more repose in his inmost being, his humor would
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
become more thoroughly genial and placid. Humor
is apt to imply but a half satisfaction at best. In
his pleasantest and most genial hour, man smiles
but as the globe smiles, and the works of nature.
The fruits <span class='it'>dry</span> ripe, and much as we relish some of
them, in their green and pulpy state, we lay up for
our winter store, not out of these, but the rustling
autumnal harvests. Though we never weary of
this vivacious wit, while we are perusing its work,
yet when we remember it from afar, we sometimes
feel balked and disappointed, missing the security,
the simplicity, and frankness, even the occasional
magnanimity of acknowledged dullness and bungling.
This never-failing success and brilliant talent
become a reproach. To the most practical reader
the humor is certainly too obvious and constant a
quality. When we are to have dealings with a
man, we prize the good faith and valor of soberness
and gravity. There is always a more impressive
statement than consists with these victorious comparisons.
Besides, humor does not wear well. It
is commonly enough said, that a joke will not bear
repeating. The deepest humor will not keep.
Humors do not circulate but stagnate, or circulate
partially. In the oldest literature, in the Hebrew,
the Hindoo, the Persian, the Chinese, it is rarely
humor, even the most divine, which still survives,
but the most sober and private, painful or joyous
thoughts, maxims of duty, to which the life of all
men may be referred. After time has sifted the
literature of a people, there is left only their <span class='sc'>Scripture</span>,
for that is <span style='font-size:smaller'>WRITING</span>, <span class='it'>par excellence</span>. This is as
true of the poets, as of the philosophers and
moralists by profession; for what subsides in any
of these is the moral only, to re-appear as dry land
at some remote epoch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We confess that Carlyle’s humor is rich, deep, and
variegated, in direct communication with the back
bone and risible muscles of the globe—and there is
nothing like it; but much as we relish this jovial,
this rapid and detergeous way of conveying one’s
views and impressions, when we would not converse
but meditate, we pray for a man’s diamond
edition of his thought, without the colored illuminations
in the margin—the fishes and dragons, and
unicorns, the red or the blue ink, but its initial letter
in distinct skeleton type, and the whole so clipped
and condensed down to the very essence of it, that
time will have little to do. We know not but we
shall immigrate soon, and would fain take with us
all the treasures of the east, and all kinds of <span class='it'>dry</span>,
portable soups, in small tin canisters, which contain
whole herds of English beeves, boiled down,
will be acceptable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difference between this flashing, fitful writing
and pure philosophy, is the difference between
flame and light. The flame, indeed, yields light,
but when we are so near as to observe the flame,
we are apt to be incommoded by the heat and
smoke. But the sun, that old Platonist, is set so
far off in the heavens, that only a genial summer-heat
and ineffable day-light can reach us. But
many a time, we confess, in wintery weather, we
have been glad to forsake the sun-light, and warm
us by these Promethean flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carlyle must undoubtedly plead guilty to the
charge of mannerism. He not only has his vein,
but his peculiar manner of working it. He has a
style which can be imitated, and sometimes is an
imitator of himself. Every man, though born and
bred in the metropolis of the world, will still have
some provincialism adhering to him; but in proportion
as his aim is simple and earnest, he approaches
at once the most ancient and the most modern men.
There is no mannerism in the Scriptures. The
style of proverbs, and indeed of all <span class='it'>maxims</span>, whether
measured by sentences or by chapters, if they
may be said to have any style, is one, and as the
expression of one voice, merely an account of the
matter by the latest witness. It is one advantage
enjoyed by men of science, that they use only formulas
which are universal. The common language
and the common sense of mankind, it is most uncommon
to meet with in the individual. Yet
liberty of thought and speech is only liberty to think
the universal thought, and speak the universal
language of men, instead of being enslaved to a
particular mode. Of this universal speech there is
very little. It is equable and sure; from a depth
within man which is beyond education and prejudice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly, no critic has anywhere said what is
more to the purpose, than this which Carlyle’s own
writings furnish, which we quote, as well for its
intrinsic merit as for its pertinence here. “It is
true,” says he, thinking of Richter, “the beaten
paths of literature lead the safeliest to the goal; and
the talent pleases us most, which submits to shine
with new gracefulness through old forms. Nor is
the noblest and most peculiar mind too noble or
peculiar for working by prescribed laws; Sophocles,
Shakspeare, Cervantes, and in Richter’s own age,
Goethe, how little did they innovate on the given
forms of composition, how much in the spirit they
breathed into them! All this is true; and Richter
must lose of our esteem in proportion.” And again,
in the chapter on Goethe, “We read Goethe for
years before we come to see wherein the distinguishing
peculiarity of his understanding, of his disposition,
even of his way of writing, consists! It
seems quite a simple style, [that of his?] remarkable
chiefly for its calmness, its perspicuity, in short, its
commonness; and yet it is the most uncommon of
all styles.” And this, too, translated for us by the
same pen from Schiller, which we will apply not
merely to the outward form of his works, but to
their inner form and substance. He is speaking of
the artist. “Let some beneficent divinity snatch
him, when a suckling, from the breast of his mother,
and nurse him with the milk of a better time, that
he may ripen to his full stature beneath a distant
Grecian sky. And having grown to manhood, let
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
him return, a foreign shape, into his century; not,
however, to delight it by his presence, but, dreadful,
like the son of Agamemnon, to purify it. The matter
of his works he will take from the present, but
their form he will derive from a nobler time; nay,
from beyond all time, from the absolute unchanging
unity of his own nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But enough of this. Our complaint is already out
of all proportion to our discontent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carlyle’s works, it is true, have not the stereotyped
success which we call classic. They are a
rich but inexpensive entertainment, at which we
are not concerned lest the host has strained or impoverished
himself to feed his guests. It is not the
most lasting word, nor the loftiest wisdom, but
rather the word which comes last. For his genius
it was reserved to give expression to the thoughts
which were throbbing in a million breasts. He has
plucked the ripest fruit in the public garden; but
this fruit already least concerned the tree that bore
it, which was rather perfecting the bud at the foot
of the leaf stalk. His works are not to be studied,
but read with a swift satisfaction. Their flavor and
gust is like what poets tell of the froth of wine,
which can only be tasted once and hastily. On a
review we can never find the pages we had read.
The first impression is the truest and the deepest,
and there is no reprint, no <span class='it'>double entendre</span>, so to
speak, for the alert reader. Yet they are in some
degree true natural products in this respect. All
things are but once, and never repeated. The first
faint blushes of the morning, gilding the mountain
tops, the pale phosphor and saffron-colored clouds
do verily transport us to the morning of creation;
but what avails it to travel eastward, or look again
there an hour hence? We should be as far in the
day ourselves, mounting toward our meridian.
These works were designed for such complete success
that they serve but for a single occasion. It is
the luxury of art, when its own instrument is manufactured
for each particular and present use. The
knife which slices the bread of Jove ceases to be a
knife when this service is rendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, Oliver, you have a case with which to commence
your career at the bar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thanks to Uncle Scott, I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you allow me to ask what it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to tell you that, I must first know myself.
I believe it to be in relation to a contested will, but
as to the particulars you are as wise as I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A will case, eh! I have heard old lawyers say
they were the best of cases, as far as fee is concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow I am to have an interview with my
client. My uncle gave such a glowing description
of her that he has quite raised my curiosity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady for a client! why that’s better yet. By
the bye, Oliver, you seem somewhat indifferent to
the divine sex; and yet you have a warm heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For friendship, James, but how can I think of
love, the owner of the six chairs, book-case and
table you see, and nothing but my profession to
rely on for the future. Love never flourishes in so
stern a climate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have the best authority for knowing that it
lives through the fiercest tempest, as well as under
the beautiful skies of Italy. What do you think,
Oliver, of a rich wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think such advice comes very badly from you.
Let me ask in turn why you are about to connect
yourself with a penniless girl, when you might win
the greatest fortune in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question came to the point, but it received
no other answer than a light laugh as the young
man turned on his heel to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Oliver, I wish you great success in the
cause of this lovely client. Good day,” said he, in
the gleeful tone of a heart free from care. And, indeed,
if this could be the condition of any mortal in
this care-worn world, it was that of James Ashly.
Thus far in life his path had been strewn with
flowers, and in the horizon of the future no clouds
were visible. The son of an opulent merchant,
endowed by nature with a good mind, and possessing
in a rare degree that animation only to be acquired
by intercourse with gay society, he was an
unusual favorite with those in whose company he
mingled, especially the fairer portion, whose gentle
hearts are ever gracious, to that easy air and manner,
too much neglected by their fancied lords and
superiors. But he joined with these superficial
graces of address, a cultivated intellect, stored with
much useful information, which are so seldom
united as to be deemed inconsistent, if not antagonistical.
By the latter he retained all the good will
and esteem which by the former he gained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his extensive acquaintance no friend was
more valued than Oliver Barton, a young lawyer,
in whose office the above conversation occurred,
and whose fortune consisted of little more than a
well-furnished mind and generous heart—a kind of
wealth little appreciated in this matter-of-fact world.
He had been educated by a maternal uncle, who
rejoiced in the name of Scott, and having made
choice of the legal profession, was fitted in due
course for the bar. In the maiden speech he delivered,
shortly after his admission, he gave promise
of future eminence and distinction. Unlike his
friend, he was reserved and somewhat diffident, but
his intrinsic worth and handsome form won favor
and respect by less striking, but equally certain
means. It was only when well known that those
nice shades of merit, which so permanently recommend
their possessor, could be discovered in his
character. His prominent forehead and rather
heavy brow gave a slight shade of melancholy to
his countenance, but their intellectual expression,
increased by the steady light of a dark eye, commanded
admiration. When he smiled a row of
glistening teeth revealed themselves, and his features
were lit up with a life and joy rendered more
striking by their usual thoughtful repose.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Oliver Barton proceeded to his
office at an earlier hour than usual; so early indeed
that most of those adjoining were still closed. Being
of a meditative turn of mind, and even inclined to
castle-building, this era of his life afforded much
subject for thought. “If I succeed,” thought he, “it
will be the commencement of an extensive practice.”
Forthwith, upon this contingency, he proceeded
to erect a magnificent superstructure in the
air, which was finally blown away by it occurring
to him that he might <span class='it'>not</span> succeed. Unwilling to
contemplate this side of the picture, and remembering
his client was a lady, he took from the table
before him “Chesterfield’s Letters,” in hopes of finding
something there both useful and entertaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the agreeable wit and advice
of his lordship, the hours passed heavily. At last
in came Uncle Scott, a little, genteel-looking person,
in tight pantaloons and well-brushed coat, carrying
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
his ivory-headed cane under his arm. He looked
the very personification of a precise old bachelor,
who had lived in the great world and grown wise
by experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, according to appointment,” said he,
pulling a showy watch from its fob, “just half past
twelve, and we are to be at Miss Medford’s at one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ready, uncle,” returned Oliver, after having
changed his coat and settled his hat before the glass
with extra attention. Mr. Scott, like most old
bachelors, was very punctual in fulfilling engagements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me, I believe, that Miss Medford was
an orphan?” said Oliver, when they had reached
the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, poor thing,” answered Mr. Scott, “she lost
her mother while still an infant, and it has now been
ten years since her father, Charles Medford, died.
He was a generous, noble-hearted fellow, but too
much given to fine company and expense. I recollect
him well, for we were young men together,
and dashed about in the same gay society. He
married a beautiful woman for love,” and Uncle
Scott sighed, “with her face for her fortune, and as
his own amounted to little more, the match was
any thing but happy. To be deprived of the only
parent she had ever known nearly broke Clara’s
heart, and she wept long and bitterly. So touching
was her grief it affected the heart of her uncle, John
Medford, who, as he was a bachelor, adopted her,
and resolved to cherish her as his own. He was
one of the most singular men I have ever known.
Withered and forbidding in appearance, crabbed in
temper, and particular about money matters even
to parsimony, he was no attractive object to so
tender a flower as Clara. But, by her childish love
and attention, she insinuated herself into his unkindly
heart, and soothed the many cares of the declining
years of his life—so that even he blessed
her. At his death the principal amount of his property
was bequeathed to her, but with this singular
provision, that if she marry within ten years it was
to go to some distant relative. Among the many
whims of the old man, he particularly hated a
branch of his family, the children of a disobedient
sister. These are now endeavoring to prove the
illegality of the will in question, as they are entirely
cut off by it from all share in his estate; but
you shall hear more of the circumstances from her
own lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were now at their destination, and in a
few moments found themselves seated in a spacious
and richly furnished parlor, containing many indications
of female taste and attention. On the
centre-table lay a small boquet of beautiful flowers,
blushing with the freshness of the field, but which,
on a closer inspection, were found to be artificial,
doubtless moulded under the delicate fingers of the
presiding fairy. A number of beautifully shaded
landscape sketches next attracted Oliver’s attention,
and as he turned from one to another he would
have forgotten the dry subject on which he came,
but for the promptings of Mr. Scott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not waited long before Clara Medford
entered. If Oliver had been affected by her story
he was still more touched with her winning grace
and beauty, enhanced rather than obscured by the
deep mourning in which she was dressed. She
was somewhat pale, but he would have found no
difficulty in accounting for this in her late affliction,
had not the sweet expression of her hazel eye more
than atoned for it. Her mien was so easy and unaffected
that Oliver, who had dreaded the awkward
formality of so embarrassing an interview, felt at
once perfectly self-possessed. There was something
serene and even childlike in her countenance,
which was extremely interesting, and she seemed
polite, rather because it was natural to her, than in
obedience to the requirements of custom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We leave them to converse over the business of
the suit, of which the reader already knows sufficient
for the purposes of our narrative.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Some weeks after the scene of our last chapter,
Clara Medford was sitting where the young attorney
had first seen her. Jane Preston, an intimate friend,
who had called to pay a morning visit, sat by her
side on the sofa with bonnet and shawl still on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Clara,” said she, changing their conversation,
“you are now secured in the possession of this
house and all your uncle’s property; my, what
wealth! I’m sure I wish it may yield you all the
happiness you desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Jane, for your kind wishes,” answered
Clara mildly, “but I have thought that wealth seldom
confers as much real happiness as it brings additional
care and anxiety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your care, unlike that of others, ends for the
best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, I have no disappointment to complain of,”
said Clara, “but my success is only a negative pleasure,
after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure I should think it a very positive one,”
returned Miss Preston, as she rose to go. Clara
pressed her to stay longer, but, pleading an engagement,
she proceeded to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Clara,” said she, continuing their conversation
on the steps, “do tell me who young Lawyer
Barton is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know little more of him than that he is very
talented in his profession,” replied Clara, slightly
blushing, more at the manner in which it was asked
than at the question itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard he was very retired, and went but
little into company,” continued Jane, giving information
when she found none was to be obtained. “But
every one agrees that he has conducted your late
suit with great ability, for which, I suppose, you are
very grateful,” said she, with an arch side glance at
her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, sincerely so,” returned Clara seriously, but
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
with a rapid change of countenance she added,
“Oh! Jane, I almost forgot to ask you whether you
have yet appointed a day to gratify your sighing
swain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed she, blushing crimson in turn,
“I’ll tell you when we’ve more time, for it’s a
long story. Good-by, Clara, don’t be too grateful
to the handsome Mr. Barton,” and with a ringing, joyous
laugh, she tripped lightly down the marble steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by,” returned Clara, gazing after her retiring
form, and almost envying her the happy spirit
with which she was animated.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>At the time the above conversation occurred,
Oliver Barton was meditating on his encouraging
success in the late trial, alone in the office where
twice before we have seen him. There was a more
than usual melancholy in the expression of his
countenance. His head rested on his hand, and at
intervals he would heave an involuntary sigh, as
though his thoughts were of no agreeable nature.
One would have concluded that some great misfortune,
rather than triumphant success, had befallen
him. At length he was roused from his reverie by
the sound of rapid footsteps in the entry, and in another
moment James Ashly had entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Oliver,” said he, “so you exerted your
eloquence to some purpose. I knew when I saw
your eye that you intended carrying all before you.
But,” continued he, observing the dejected mood of
his friend, “what is the matter—have you heard of
the death of any near relative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Oliver, “I ought, I know, to be
very happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have cause to be so, certainly; then what
has made you look like a man contemplating
suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, James,” said Oliver, in a calm tone,
and composing himself as with an effort, “and I will
tell you the cause; I confide in your friendship,
because I know its sincerity. The truth is, my
sentiments toward Miss Medford are not those of
mere admiration, they are warmer; I feel that I
love her,” and starting from his chair, he strode
rapidly across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, Oliver,” urged James, when the first surprise
of so unexpected an announcement was over,
“is it cause of grief to love a girl so amiable and
beautiful as Miss Medford? You are already
esteemed by her, and time may incline her heart
to a more tender sentiment. There is but one
short step between friendship and love. This suit
is now so happily terminated—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have named the most embittering reflection
of all,” said Oliver, stopping before him and speaking
earnestly; “by that decision the validity of a will
is established, which deprives her of the right to dispose
of her hand. By its mandate she must resign
all; and what could I offer to compensate her for
the sacrifice? The homage of my heart, and the
devotion of my life, are worthless trifles. I knew,
while striving to establish her rights, that if successful
I sealed my own unhappiness, and forever
cut off all hope of calling her mine. I even debated
with myself whether I might not lose the case by
mismanagement, and then win the heart of the
trusting, beautiful Clara. It was a great conflict for
a single moment, but the temptation yielded to a
sense of honor and justice. Her cause triumphed;
and at least I have the melancholy satisfaction left
of knowing that I served the one I love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliver spoke with the eloquence of despair, and
his friend listened, engrossed in astonishment and
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can appreciate the feelings which so trying a
situation prompts, but,” added he, the naturally
sanguine disposition of his mind prevailing over its
first gloomy sensations, “trust to time for a happy
termination; for although your way is now overhung
with clouds, as you advance into the future, it
will become brighter, and a glorious store of happiness
will be opened to your view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words bid me hope,” answered Oliver,
“but I fear while you utter them your heart misgives
you. No, no, James—I see no room for hope,
nothing to brighten my path with a solitary ray of
comfort. I must try to banish her image from my
heart, and think of her only in connexion with every
thing lovely and perfect, never as my first and only
love. I can but make the effort, though I believe it
will fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>James was sensible of all the deep despair and
silently corroding influence of “hope deferred;” its
dreams and disappointments; its moments of bright
anticipation succeeded by still darker views of the
stern reality; its overwhelming anguish, and its
rush of mad gayety more dreadful than tears. He
knew, too, the depth of passionate feeling of which
Oliver’s heart was capable, and shuddered as he
thought that the soul of one so generous and noble
would be made the prey of that slow and deadly
poison, hopeless love. But by an effort he suppressed
the rising emotions of his breast, and continued
to urge the possibility of the future removing
the obstacles which now appeared so formidable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not to be expected,” said he, “nay, it is impossible,
that one so young and beautiful should remain
single, in mere obedience to the foolish whim
of an uncle, no longer living. If her heart become
engaged, she will soon resign the gold, which is but a
useless burthen, and some one less scrupulous will
possess the hand that might be your own. Besides,
will she not appreciate the struggle you have endured,
and the sacrifice of self in your conduct? And these
aided by the gratitude she already feels, are sufficient
to win the heart of any maiden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the view thus presented, skillfully colored
by the hand of friendship, could not change the determination
he had expressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was I,” said Oliver, “who undertook the case,
and succeeded in securing to her the full benefit of
her uncle’s will; knowing, then, its provisions,
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
would it not be inconsistent, even fraudulent, in me
to attempt to defeat it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this James could oppose nothing, for he felt the
delicacy of his friend’s situation; he knew how deep
was the suffering excited by that absorbing passion
of the soul when struggling with adversity or oppression,
and his own heart swelled with a generous
sympathy, as he grasped the hand of his friend on
parting.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Again we take a leap over a period of time which,
to those in the enjoyment of a life of pleasure and
excitement, appears short, but to the sufferer on a
bed of sickness, or the condemned felon, is an age.
They, in whom we are more immediately interested,
thought it either brief or tedious, as it brought good
or ill fortune. James Ashly, though deeply concerned
in the distress of his friend, was enabled by
the elasticity of his spirits to preserve that sprightly
air, which had in a manner become habitual. But
he had much real cause for joy. The girl who had
long reigned mistress of his heart, had consented to
become a bride, and appointed a day for the wedding.
As for Oliver Barton, a heavy cloud rested
on his brow, denoting deep-seated grief. In vain
his friend tried to entertain him, and draw his mind
from the melancholy subject on which it continually
brooded; in vain Oliver himself endeavored to carry
out his resolution, and banish all thought of Clara
Medford from his mind; the effort only proved the
strength of his affection. But it was not weakness;
he could have trusted himself in her society, conversed
with, worshiped her, and yet <a id='kept'></a>kept the secret
buried in his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oliver,” said uncle Scott one day, bustling into
his nephew’s office, with a huge book under his
arm, which looked as though it might have been
bound near the beginning of the seventeenth century,
“here is an old relic of your family, which I
think you have never seen—no less than the family
Bible, containing a record of the births, marriages,
and deaths, of the ancestors in whose connexion
you have just reason to be proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was delivered with all the importance of
one communicating a valuable secret, never doubting
that Oliver would feel as lively an interest as
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, in fact,” continued he, “a complete history
of the house for several generations back. The
character of the writer is shown in the chirography
much better than in many a prosy biography.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliver expressed much more interest in the “old
relic” than he really felt, from a desire to please an
indulgent uncle by humoring his whims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father,” continued Mr. Scott, spreading the
old volume before him, and looking intently on it,
“you will observe, was an only son, with two sisters,
Mary and Catharine Blake. The former died early;
here is the record in his own hand.” Oliver gazed
on with awakened attention. “The latter married
Charles Blake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her name, then, was Catharine Blake,” said
Oliver, earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Mr. Scott, “it was; my recollection
serves me to recall an incident in relation
to her marriage. It was this; John Medford loved
her devotedly, but she could never return his affection,
and finally bestowed her hand on Charles Blake,
who had nothing but spotless worth and intelligence
to recommend him. She left no children, and is
long since dead; but Medford, who always cherished
an affection for her, could never be persuaded of
the truth of the report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This account was heard by Oliver with breathless
attention, and as he examined the venerable record,
a glow of intense joy lit up his face. Observing this,
Mr. Scott proceeded further back into the annals of
the Bartons, and expiated on the events and eras
with critical exactness. But the mind of his nephew
was engrossed by what he had already learned,
and he scarcely heard the list of marriages, and
intermarriages, deaths, and births, which his uncle
recounted with painful minuteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ray of hope,” exclaimed he, “has already
dawned, destined probably to shed a propitious fight
on my path. James was right; the future may yet
have a store of happiness provided for me, too
great even to contemplate.”</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>A goodly company was assembled in the lofty
parlors of Miss Medford’s residence. The young,
the gay, the serious, the frivolous, were there in indiscriminate
profusion; some chatting familiarly on
the luxurious sofas and lounges, others walking or
standing beneath the chandelier, and not a few engaged
in unseen, as they thought, flirtations in the
corners. The young and the old of both sexes
seemed to enjoy the scene with a <a id='pecu'></a>peculiar relish.
The flowers sparkled in their vases, under the rich
light of the numerous lamps; the jewels glistened,
their owners smiled, and all was gay, happy, and
inspiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among that numerous and fashionable company,
James Ashly was the most joyful of the joyous, the
happiest of the happy. His heart had secured the
prize for which it had so long contended—its constant
love had been crowned with success; and in
the sweet being leaning on his arm, he felt he possessed
such a treasure as the world could not equal.
After a prolonged courtship, Jane Preston became
his bride—and they were now the admired of all
admirers. The small figure and benevolent countenance
of Mr. Scott were not less conspicuous in the
crowd of happy faces which thronged the apartments,
whose walls had never witnessed so animated
a scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was one individual who seemed to
have no connexion with any one present. He sat
by himself, and took no part in the conversation of
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
either the young or old. His countenance bore
deep traces of habitual care and discontent, which,
with the wrinkles of age, gave it a sour and forbidding
aspect. Dressed in a blue coat, which might
have fitted him when it was made, but now hung
loosely about his form; straight-collared vest, too
long and too loose; and pantaloons of the greatest
redundancy of cloth—he appeared to no advantage,
nor did he seem to care. A nervous uneasiness
pervaded his frame, as though contemplating something
beyond the mere pleasure of being present.
Sometimes his attention was attracted by a witty
remark, or joyful laugh, but he would turn away
his head, and smile dismally, as though he envied
the happy heart from which it echoed. The name
of this person was <a id='san'></a>Sandford. He had been engaged
in business with the deceased Mr. Medford, and
was in every respect a congenial spirit. At his
death, Sandford was left executor, and entrusted
with the administration of the will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasion which brought together this various
company, and gave it so lively a tone, was no less
than the marriage of the modest and charming Clara
Medford to the handsome and talented Oliver Barton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour approached when the knot was to be
tied, and the grave minister, in his robes, was already
present. A bustle was suddenly perceptible through
the rooms as the youthful couple entered, the bride
blushing to the borders of her dress, and the groom,
it must be confessed, paler than usual. The ceremony
began with that embarrassment always attending
such occasions; and many a heart palpitated
with mingled emotions of joy and terror under the
solemn and impressive voice of the clergyman. The
earnest appeal was made for those who knew of
any impediment “to speak now, or ever after hold
their peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This lady,” said Sandford, in the pause that followed,
with the astonished eyes of every one fixed
on him, “this lady, by the present act, forfeits, according
to her uncle’s will, all title to his wealth,
which is to go to one Catharine Blake, or her heirs,
if she be not living. I thought it proper to make
this declaration, as the legal executor of the deceased
Mr. Medford. The ceremony may now proceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, sir,” said Oliver Barton, “the only surviving
heir of Catharine Blake you will recognize in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whisper of delight ran through the rooms at
this unexpected <span class='it'>dénouement</span>; the service proceeded,
and in a few moments, tears, kisses, and confusion
announced the silken bands of matrimony had
firmly united two as pure, confiding hearts as ever
throbbed in human breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus the case was doubly gained.</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<div><h1><a id='aunt'></a>MY AUNT FABBINS’S OLD GARRET.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY C. P. CRANCH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have often wondered whether there ever was in
our whole blessed United States, such a queer place as
my Aunt Fabbins’s garret. In all my migrations from
city to city, from house to house, from room to room,
where I was the guest of people who were quite
differently constituted by nature and education from
my good aunt, I have thought to myself as I observed
somewhat of the family economy in these
various hospitable abodes, that there could not possibly
be in a single one of them a room whose internal
arrangement or disarrangement bore the faintest
resemblance to that queer old garret at my Aunt
Fabbins’s. Oh, it was the queerest of all queer
places that the sun ever peeped into or did not peep
into. Language utterly fails to tell how queer it was.
I have sometimes thought I would seriously sit
down and describe it at length; that I would take
an inventory of all the queer things it contained, one
by one, with scientific patience and accuracy, and
give to the herein unenlightened world the results
of my researches and labors, in the shape of an
article for some antiquarian society, or, perhaps,
some national academy of arts and sciences. Catacombs
and tombs, and Egyptian pyramids, have
been thrown open to the gaze of mankind, and the
dim religious light of old cloisters and cathedrals
has been invaded by the prying spirit of utilitarian
curiosity and reform; and that which was hidden
and mysterious, hath been everywhere brought into
the atmosphere of vulgar daylight, and Penny Magazines,
and Lyceum Lectures—and science every
where is laying his cold clutch upon the shrinking
form of poetic truth; then why should not the secrets
of my Aunt Fabbins’s queer old musty fusty garret
be disclosed, and the world be one little wrinkle
the wiser?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I do not propose to treat this old garret and
its contents scientifically or chronologically—perhaps
I shall treat it hardly reverentially; and though
there was many a monument therein of past years,
and many a hieroglyphic of deep significance were
the key only known, yet I shall modestly decline
entering the lists with Champollion or Mr. Gliddon.
Other spirits more peculiarly gifted with powers of
investigation than myself, may, at some future time,
visit my aunt’s house, and if they should be favored
by chance, or by friendship, to enter that dim upper
receptacle of the shadows of the past, they may more
fully explore a field which I have scarcely had the
courage or patience to do with completeness and
accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before I enlighten my readers upon the subject
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
of this old garret and its arcana, it will be necessary
for me to give a glance at one feature in the
domestic economy of my Aunt and Uncle Fabbins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A worthier and more warm-hearted old couple
never lived. For forty years they had shared the
joys and sorrows of life together; they had known
many trials, but these had only bound them more
closely to each other, and to Heaven. They had
married early, and brought up a large family, like
good parents and good Christians as they were. In
the earlier period of their wedded state, they had
both, through habit and necessity, managed all their
domestic affairs with the strictest economy. They
were perfect patterns of housekeeping and management
to their neighbors. With the extravagant
Southerners, among whom they lived (for my uncle
and aunt emigrated from the land of steady habits,
old Massachusetts, soon after their marriage, into a
more southern latitude, for the same reasons, I suppose,
which carry so many of our young couples,
nowadays, off to the west); among these Southerners,
I say, my Uncle and Aunt Fabbins were absolute
wonders, so different were their habits from those
about them. There was no end, no bound to the
wonder of these people. They could not comprehend
how, with their limited income, they contrived
to live so snugly and genteelly. The richest families
among them could not keep their household arrangements
from going “out in the elbows.” In the
winter time they never could keep their parlors
warm, or their doors shut. Their windows <span class='it'>would</span>
rattle; the wind <span class='it'>would</span> blow in, bringing influenza
and consumption on its wings; they <span class='it'>could</span> not keep
their closets supplied with medicines, or even always
with the necessary eatables of life, but were somehow
or other obliged to borrow of the Fabbins’s.
And in summer, they would leave their windows
open to every rain, or their chimneys would tumble
down, or their garden-tools would get lost or broken,
or their children catch the ague and fever, from running
about in puddles, or eating green fruit; and then
the whole family establishment and family counsel
and assistance of the Fabbins’s were taxed for the ill-management
of these extravagant and improvident
neighbors. If a pump-handle were loose, or needed
oiling, no one could put it to rights like Uncle Fabbins.
If a wheelbarrow or rake were broken, they invariably
borrowed of neighbor Fabbins. If a baby had the croup,
the whole family came in a committee of the whole
to wait on the Fabbins’s; Uncle Fabbins must prescribe
the physic, and weigh it out, and Aunt Fabbins
must leave her sewing, or her pickling, or her ironing,
and run in to put the child into a warm bath. If
a neighboring housewife wanted a quart of meal,
or a loaf of bread, or a pound of butter, she would
not scruple to send at all hours of the day, or night
to draw upon Mrs. Fabbins’s exhaustless store-house.
Everybody knew just where to go when any sudden
want or emergency overtook them. I remember
hearing of a man who sent out his servant to one
of his neighbors’ houses, when a thunder storm was
coming up, to give his master’s compliments, and
“please wouldn’t he lend him his <span class='it'>lightning-rod</span> for
a little while.” I have never heard that my uncle’s
neighbors ever went quite so far in their neighborly
feelings as this, but I do remember hearing my aunt
relate one circumstance nearly as amusing as this.
A storm was coming up, and all the windows and
doors were closed—not a sign of any living creature
was seen abroad, save a few lazy cows, who
began to think it best to retire to their apartments
in their respective cow-yards. The sky was growing
darker and darker; the wind swept by over
trees and dusty roads in fearful gusts; a few large
rain-drops were beginning to fall, and one or two
vivid flashes of lightning had cleft the dark clouds,
followed by tremendous claps of thunder; when a
small boy was seen running violently toward my
uncle’s house—a loud knocking was heard—the
summons was answered—and the embassy was not
exactly to borrow a lightning-rod, for there were
none in those days, I believe, but, “mother says,
please lend her”—“What, child, is anybody dying?”
“No, marm, but mother says, please lend her—a
<span class='it'>nutmeg</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Parturiunt Montes!</span>” I said to myself, when I
heard it, (it was in my college days, when I was
fond of Latin quotations,) “<span class='it'>et nascitur ridiculus mus</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is not altogether a digression from my subject.
I will come to the garret presently, after I
have patiently conducted my readers up the preliminary
steps. We must always begin at the bottom
of the stairs before we can get to the top; that
old garret may be called the flower, <span class='it'>run to seed</span>, of
all this beautiful economy in the household affairs of
the Fabbins’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, a beautiful system of economy.
The Fabbins’s homestead was a little world in itself
of ways and means—a microcosm, where, for years,
every thing that was needed stood at hand ready for
use, and every thing had its place. You could not
lay your hand upon the merest bit of broken crockery,
or rusty nail, or weather-stained shingle, or fragment
of tangled twine, but it came into service, sooner or
later, in some part of the establishment—at least so
my aunt always affirmed. Honor to these good
old folks for their principles and their practice. If
the world—if society at large—if government could
but take a lesson from these humble lights of their
little circle, how much poverty, and crime, and
misery, would be avoided, which now runs riot
over the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! there is an old adage which will come
sneaking into the corner of my brain, as I continue
to trace my way up toward the old garret—some
cynic philosopher must have given it birth; “too
much of a good thing is good for nothing.” Rather
harsh, friend philosopher, but the rough shell may
be found to contain a kernel of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here I am much disposed to fall into some
deep reflections, and give utterance to some very
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
profound remarks, and even go into some winding
digressions about the philosophy of ultraism, and
show how there is no one truth, or good principle,
which, if emphasized too strongly and exclusively,
may not result in a falsity and an evil. Virtue may
become vice, truth error, if we persist in riding our
favorite hobby forever in the same way, and on the
same road. Let us not dwell forever in the parts
and particles of good, but in the whole. Let us not
breathe the gasses, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or
carbonic acid, but <span class='it'>air</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having taken my patient reader this long step
upward, we come to a landing and a breathing place
on the stairs. Let us have a little more patience
yet, and we shall finally come to the garret. I
already, in fancy, begin to inhale its musty fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting uniformly on this principle of throwing
away or destroying nothing that might, at some
future time, be turned to account in some of the departments
of the household economy, my good uncle
and aunt had gradually accumulated around them
a little of every thing that was ever known or
thought of in the memorandum-book of a housekeeper.
It so happened that they had gone through
several removals from one house to another, in their
forty years of housekeeping, (they always had an
aversion to boarding,) and all their effects from the
greatest to the least, from looking-glasses and bedsteads
down to broken saucers and barrel-hoops,
were always taken along with them. Not a scrap
of any kind, were it nothing more than an old newspaper,
or a dozen of old broken corks, was ever
suffered to be thrown away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” said my aunt’s youngest daughter,
Jemima, once, on the eve of one of their removals,
“I shall throw away these old bits of rusty iron—they
cannot possibly be of any use to us; they have
been lying in this corner for years, and the spiders
have made a grand nest among them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t throw them away, child!” said my
aunt, “they’ll all come into use. Waste not, want
not, my dear. When you live to be as old as I am,
you will be cured of these extravagant whims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother, what use can possibly be made of
them?” said Jemima.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use enough, my dear,” said my aunt. “Stop up
rat holes, made into hinges—plenty of use for them;
at any rate the blacksmith will buy them—any thing
rather than throw them away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother, these bits of broken window-glass,
and these old cracked cups, and that worn-out old
coffee-mill, without a tooth in its head, and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>shan’t</span> throw them away, child, I tell you—I
shall find some use for them if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother, those old boots of Frank’s, that are
all out at the toes, and down at the heels, and no
soles to them, and all mouldy and green⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, child, you shan’t.” Just then in bustled
Uncle Fabbins, with three barrel-staves under one
arm, on which hung a basket of old, dry blacking
bottles, and extending the other at full length, at the
extremity of which appeared four worn-out, dirty
tooth-brushes, of various patterns and ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here,” he exclaimed, “I guess this is some
of your doings, Jemima—when will you learn to be
economical. Here I found all these lying on the
ground, where, to all appearance, they had been
thrown from the windows. Waste not, want not,
my child. Why can’t you take a lesson of good
housekeeping from your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, father,” said Jemima, hardly restraining her
mirth, “what on earth can you do with those old
tooth-brushes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do with them?—clean your lamps with them—rub
your brasses—keep a great many of your things
bright and clean. Do with them? I think <span class='it'>I</span> could
find use enough for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that he carefully wrapped up the much
abused instruments of cleanliness in a piece of brown
paper, which he carefully drew from his pocket,
and as carefully unfolded, and placed them in a
corner of his basket, along with the quondam receptacles
of Day and Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus it went on for years—this gradual accumulation;
and as the sons and daughters grew up
into more independence of thought and habit, it became
not unfrequently, especially at the spring or
fall house-cleaning, a bone—no, not exactly a bone,
but a sort of <span class='it'>ossification</span> of contention between parents
and offspring. But the old folks had their way, and
by following out steadfastly their principles of
economy, even inoculated the younger branches of
the family tree to some extent with their peculiarities
in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As long ago as my first acquaintance in my Aunt
Fabbins’s family, I remember these heaps and accretions
of useless rubbish. I remember how they excited
my boyish curiosity and imagination. Visions
of dark closets piled to the very ceiling with all the
nameless odds and ends in the annals of housekeeping,
are even now hovering before me. There
were strata and substrata—primary, secondary, and
tertiary formations. There were shelves, and boxes,
and old chests, and barrels of things which seemed
as if they never had a name, much less a use—things
that seemed as if they must have dropped
out of the moon, or might have once belonged to
some inhabitant of the planet Saturn, who had come
to take lodgings on our earth, and had forgotten to
take away all his old traps. Every closet, nook and
corner of the house was filled with these antique
remnants. For years the process of accumulation
had gone on, silently, and almost invisibly, like the
formation of stalactites in a cave. And whenever
it became absolutely necessary that a portion of the
rubbish should be removed—do not for a moment
suppose that it was thrown into the street, or sold
at auction, or even given to the poor, (although
my Aunt Fabbins was charity herself to all who
were in want,) but every thing was taken from below
stairs, and transferred to the garret. This was the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
great receptacle of all fragments—this was the final
resting-place—the charnel-house, or say rather kingdom
of the dead, where the ghosts of the departed
dumb servants of the household at last congregated
in peaceful and undisturbed repose. And now
we have reached this dim land of shadows at length,
not as the ancients did, by descending, but by
ascending—to the very top of the house, we may
draw forth our key and unlock the sacred door,
and enter, reverently if we can—we have reached</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span style='font-size:smaller'>MY AUNT FABBINS’S GARRET.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>But, ah! how can I describe it, when I have no
other light but memory to enable me to grope
through it? Yet will I endeavor, as well as I can,
to throw a little light upon this dark, silent abode of
mysteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We open the door, then. A strong odor,—compounded
of various ingredients, the chief of which
seem to be salt fish, bacon, grease, dried herbs and
old leather,—assails our olfactories;—“A most ancient
and fish-like smell, a sort of, not the newest,
poorjohn.” We enter a dark apartment, with a
low ceiling, the greater part of it sloping with the
roof, and very much stained by the rains which
have leaked through. A dim light beams through
a single window, the panes of which are very dusty
and cracked. We will seat ourselves on a couple
of old candle-boxes, and commence our inventory
of the contents in all due form, as well as the light
of memory and the dim window-glass will permit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item. A pair of old buckskin breeches hanging
on the wall, which once adorned the legs of my
Uncle Fabbins himself, some forty-five years ago.
Alas! where are the buff waistcoat, the sky-blue
coat, the buckled-shoes, the three-cornered hat, and
the long cane that used to accompany this affecting
relic of the past? And could Echo speak, in an
apartment so crowded as this, she would answer,
as she does to the poets—where?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item, secondly. An old sword—also hanging
against the wall. We will take it down—we will
draw it from its rusty scabbard. What! can that be
blood upon its blade? Ah, no! nothing but spots of
rust—and the blade is duller than my uncle’s dullest
hoe. It was never sharpened for the battle—it is
guiltless of ever shedding a drop of blood—it never
was used but in piping times of peace, by my
uncle’s eldest son Ebenezer, when he belonged to
a company of cavalry. It will never again see a
training day—it will remain in its corner till my
uncle and aunt’s effects descend to their children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item, thirdly. A barrel of old business letters,
receipted bills, leaves torn out of Latin grammars
and books of arithmetic; old newspapers, that were
fresh once—in the days of the Revolution—but are
now so stale and fusty that the very rats turn from
them with disgust. “All this old paper will come
into use, yet,” says my Aunt Fabbins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Item, fourthly. But I see plainly that at this rate
we shall never get through—we must take the garret
<span class='it'>en masse</span>, and present a rough sketch of the
whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Picture, then, to yourself a medley somewhat like
what follows; to wit: old broken bedsteads, and
worn-out sacking; a battered warming-pan; a copper
kettle, with a great hole in the bottom; a quantity
of old bottles and phials, pots of paint dried up
as hard as granite, old stumps of paint brushes,
shreds of canvas, broken casts and an easel, once
the property of a poor painter who once was a
boarder in my uncle’s house; pine-boards and scraps
of mahogany furniture, of every shape and size—old
rags—old mouldy boots and shoes—old picture-frames;
bits of window-glass and looking-glass; old
rusty keys, old coffee-mills—and great iron wheels
that seem as incomprehensible as those of Ezekiel;
old greasy boxes, with something old and mysterious
in every one of them—battered old trunks,
without tops to them; quantities of empty bottles,
and one or two forsaken demijohns, (my uncle and
aunt have joined the Temperance Society;) great
heaps of rusty iron—saws without handles or teeth;
locks without keys or springs; scraps of bell-wire;
bells without tongues; doll-babies without heads or
legs; broken-down chairs and tables; knives and
forks without handles, broken pitchers, bags of dried
sage, antiquated andirons, fire-shovels, tongs, fenders
and battered fire-boards, and—but I can remember
no more—the rest the reader may fill out
<span class='it'>ad libitum</span>. My recording muse halts, and hastens
out to take a whiff of fresh air, and refresh her soul
with something green and living—something that
belongs to the present rather than to the past. We
will leave this museum of antiquities, though we
have not half described it, and transport ourselves
to my aunt’s snug little breakfast parlor, on the first
floor. Time—about a year ago, one fine spring
morning, after breakfast. Present—Aunt Fabbins,
Uncle Fabbins, the five Miss Fabbinses, and the
three Mr. Fabbinses, my cousins, myself and the cat.
The ladies were washing up the breakfast things
and putting the room in order, my uncle was reading
the paper, and the three sons and myself—contemplating
the rest of the party; when the following
conversation arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” said Jemima, partly to herself, and partly
that her father and mother might hear—“I wish,
upon my soul, that something would happen which
would clear this house of some of its rubbish. I
can’t find room for these books on the shelf, for the
old newspapers have taken complete possession. I
am obliged to convert the top of my piano into a
book-shelf—and I don’t think I shall submit to it.
There is no room for half the things that are in the
house. I have half a mind, I declare, to turn some
of these piles of trash into the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are just my sentiments, Jemima,” said
doctor Peter, the youngest son—“I’ll help you,
Jemima—just go ahead, and I’ll second you. The
fact is, I’ve long been of the opinion that the whole
house, from top to bottom, needs a thorough treatment.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
It is as full as a boa constrictor that has
swallowed a calf—it will tumble down with its own
weight, one of these days, and die of repletion. It
needs blood-letting. Confound me, if I can find an
inch of room for my chemical experiments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Susan, “and all my beautiful plants
I am obliged to keep out of doors, exposed to the
night frosts, to make room for that old desk of
father’s, which is filled with empty ink-bottles and
pamphlets and sermons half a century old, that nobody,
not even he, ever thinks of reading. It would
be such a nice little corner for my flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my opinion,” said Frank, “I really think a
fire would do the house good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” said my aunt, in a tone of horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” said Frank, “if the old house caught
fire, and burned—a little—I don’t mean much—but
just a little, it would greatly purify us. We should
have room to breathe—and I should have room for
my gun and dogs and fishing-tackle. I really should
laugh to see the old garret go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” said my aunt, solemnly, “you speak
like a fool. When you get to be as old as your
father and mother, you will alter your tone. Will
my children <span class='it'>ever</span> learn economy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle here looked up over his spectacles,
solemnly at Frank, and approvingly at his wife, but
said nothing, and went on reading the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of my cousins said little, and rather
took sides with their parents. The fact was, they
were growing old and conservative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ebenezer thought the house was very well as it
was; and he for one did not wish to see any thing
cleared out—unless, indeed, it were in some places,
where he needed a closet or two for his bugs and
butterflies and geological specimens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my good aunt still persisted in maintaining
that there was nothing in the whole house that
could be spared, and that sooner or later every thing
would come into use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such little altercations as this not unfrequently
arose in the Fabbins family circle; but I have not
yet heard that they have resulted in any change or
reform in the administration of the internal affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O, Spirit of Conservatism! I have seen thee in
the first green buds of thy spring time and thy
youth, when thou wast a necessary and wholesome
plant, in commonwealths as in families;—I have
beheld thee again bursting into bloom, when thou
wast still a beautiful and fragrant flower, smiling
serenely and lovingly in thy green shady nooks, a
blessing and a protecting angel, when the weeds of
fanaticism and anarchy would spread a poisonous
blight over the fairest and most venerable things of
life;—but again, and too often, have I seen thee,
when thy blossoms have shriveled up and fallen to
the earth, and thy stalk was flowerless and leafless,
and covered with nothing but dry seed-dust, with
bugs and with cobwebs—keeping thy place in the
garden merely because thou wast <span class='it'>once</span> beautiful, but
now an unsightly cumberer of the ground, a brother
to the meanest weeds and stubble of the field!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such high-flown conceits as this I have just
uttered, never entered the brains of my Uncle and
Aunt Fabbins, and least of all would they see that it
had any thing whatever to do with their house and
its arrangements. But, good reader, if thou wilt
look into it, thou mayest find a deeper significance in
this family picture than at first meets the eye. The
most homely and common things often cover a
moral which is grounded in the very heart of universal
and primal truth. If thou readest not merely
to laugh, but to think, this little sketch may guide
thee into the light of spiritual facts of infinite value;
may teach thee the great lesson which in our age
all must learn—to separate the spirit from the letter,
the substance from the form—and to see that the
best principle, carried to extremes and pursued
with exclusive rigor, will, in its latter end, so differ
from its beginning, that men will say, “I know
it not; this is not the friend of my youth.” And if
a straw like this I throw into the stream, may show
thee how the current sets, I shall have done something
more beside the attempt to amuse thee.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CANVAS-BACKED DUCK. (<span class='it'>Anas Valisineria.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>According to Richardson, this bird breeds in all
parts of the remote fur countries, from the 50th
parallel to their most northern limits, associating
much at this time with the ordinary tribe of ducks.
It arrives in the United States, from the north, about
the middle of October. The greater number of
them congregate about the waters of the Chesapeake
Bay, and the Susquehanna, Patapsco, Potomac,
and James rivers. Some of them descend
only to the Hudson and the Delaware, while others
are found in the sounds and bays of North Carolina,
and in most of the southern waters to the coast
of the Gulf of Mexico. They feed upon a plant
said to be a species of <span class='it'>valisineria</span>, which grows on
fresh-water shoals of from seven to nine feet, in
long, narrow, grass-like blades, four or five feet in
length; the root white, somewhat resembling small
celery. Wherever there is an abundance of this
plant the Canvas-backs resort, either to make an
occasional visit, or to take up their regular residence
for the winter. The great abundance of this food
in the waters of the Chesapeake, make those killed
in that region to be most esteemed by epicures,
possessing as they do, in a super-eminent degree,
the rich, juicy tenderness of flesh, and delicacy of
flavor which places the Canvas-back at the head
of the whole family of ducks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson, who is quite enthusiastic in his account
of this species of duck, describes its size and
plumage as follows: The Canvas-back is two feet
long, and three feet in extent, and when in good
order, weighs three pounds; the bill is large, rising
high in the head, three inches in length, and one
inch and three-eighths thick at the base, of a glossy-black;
eye very small; irides, dark-red; cheeks, and
forepart of the head, blackish-brown; rest of the
head, and greater part of the neck, bright, glossy,
reddish-chestnut, ending in a broad space of black,
that covers the upper part of the breast, and spreads
around to the back; back, scapulars, and tertials,
white, faintly marked with an infinite number of
transversely waving lines or points, as if done with
a pencil; whole lower parts of the breast, also the
belly, white, slightly penciled in the same manner,
scarcely perceptible on the breast, pretty thick toward
the vent; wing coverts, grey, with numerous
specks of blackish; primaries and secondaries,
pale slate, two or three of the latter of which, nearest
the body, are finally edged with a deep, velvety-black,
the former dusky at the tips; tail very short,
pointed, consisting of fourteen feathers, of a hoary-brown;
vent and tail coverts, black; lining of the
wing, white; legs and feet, very pale ash, the latter
three inches in width, a circumstance which partly
accounts for its great powers of swimming. The
female is somewhat less than the male, and weighs
two pounds and three-quarters; the crown is
blackish-brown; cheeks and throat of a pale drab;
neck, dull brown; breast, as far as the black extends
in the male, dull brown, skirted in places with pale
drab; beak, dusky white, crossed with fine waving
lines; belly, of the same dull white, penciled like
the back; wings, feet, and bill, as in the male; tail
coverts, dusky; vent, white, waved with brown.
The windpipe of the male has a large, flattish, concave
labyrinth, the ridge of which is covered with
a thin transparent membrane, where the trachea
enters this it is very narrow, but immediately above
swells to three times that diameter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable skill is required to enable the sportsman
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
to get within gun-shot of his favorite game.
Not only are they extremely shy, but they possess
such speed and agility in swimming and diving, as
to render pursuit hopeless, when they are only
wing-tipped by a shot. One of the most common
ways of bringing them to within the range of a gun
is by <span class='it'>tolling</span>. The gunner having affixed a red
handkerchief, or other attractive object, to the back
of a well trained dog, secrets himself on the bank,
and the dog plays backward and forward on the
margin of the stream. Impelled by curiosity, the
ducks approach the shore, and the gunner shoots
at them on the water, and as they rise. In very
cold weather it is customary to make holes in the
ice, directly above their favorite grass, and within
gunshot of a hut, or place of concealment for the
hunter, on the bank. Distressed by want of food,
the game congregates about these openings, and
falls a prey to its enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most effectual way of bagging the Canvas-back,
however, is by shooting it at night. The position
of a flock having been previously marked,
the sportsman takes to his skiff by moonlight,
and by taking advantage of the shadow of the
woody bank or cliff, paddles silently to within fifteen
or twenty yards of a flock of a thousand, among
whom he makes great slaughter. Killing them by
night, however, soon causes them to abandon the
place where they have been thus shot at. By continuing
the bait for several days in succession, they
may be decoyed to particular places, by seeds and
grain, especially wheat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with the Canvas-back, we may
notice the Pochard, or Red-Headed Duck, his near
relative, and constant associate. Feeding upon the
same kind of food, they become almost equal in
size and flavor to the Canvas-back, and are, in fact,
very frequently sold and eaten for the same. The
sportsman, of course, cannot be deceived as to the
real Canvas-back, yet it may not be superfluous to
describe the plumage of the Pochard, that others
may be enabled to detect this imposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red-head is twenty inches in length, and
two feet six inches in extent; bill, dark slate, sometimes
black, two inches long, and seven-eighths of
an inch thick at the base, furnished with a large,
broad nail at the extremity; irides, flame coloured;
plumage of the head, long, velvety, and inflated,
running high above the base of the bill; head, and
about two inches of the neck, deep, glossy, reddish-chestnut;
rest of the neck, and upper part of the
breast, black, spreading round to the back; belly,
white, becoming dusky toward the vent by closely
marked, undulating lines of black; back and scapulars,
bluish-white, rendered gray by numerous
transverse, waving lines of black; lesser wing-coverts,
brownish-ash; wing quills, very pale slate,
dusky at the tips; lower part of the back and sides,
under the wings, brownish black, crossed with
regular zigzag lines of whitish; vent, rump, tail, and
tail-coverts, black; legs and feet, dark ash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among epicures, the Pochard is ranked next to
the Canvas-back. It is sometimes met with in the
waters of North and South Carolina, and also in
Jersey and New York, but always in fresh water,
near the sea; in the waters of the Chesapeake it is
most numerous. It is abundant in Russia, in Denmark,
in the north of Germany, in England, Holland,
France, and Italy. Their walk is awkward and
difficult; their cry resembles the hollow hiss of a
serpent; and their flight different, and more rapid,
than that of the common wild duck; and the noise
of their wings is different. In the London markets
these ducks are sold under the name of Dun birds,
and are deservedly esteemed. In England they
are principally taken in decoys after the following
manner. A pond is prepared for the Pochards, as
well as for the others, and a situation is chosen
which shall possess, in the most eminent degree, the
three attractions of cover, quietness, and proximity
to the feeding-ground. It is technically called a
flight-pond, because the birds are captured when
they are first on the wing; and the nets by which
this is effected, are so placed as that they may act
to windward of the birds—as ducks always fly to
windward when they take the wing. The net
is kept ready extended on the tops of the reeds, or
other cover, upon poles, which, by means of a
counterpoise at the bottom, can be easily erected,
upon withdrawing the pins by which they are held
down; when this is done, the poles rise and elevate
the net to the height of about thirty feet; and this
takes place just as the birds are alarmed and made
to take the wing. They strike against the net, are
thrown off their balance, and are thrown on the
ground, which, all under the net, is formed into little
pens or traps, into which the birds fall, and are unable
again to take the wing. The numbers caught
in this way, at one skillful application of the net, are
often perfectly astonishing; and they tumble into
the pens, one over the other, till the lower ones are
killed, and sometimes pressed nearly flat with the
burden of their companions. It is mentioned that,
on some parts of the Essex coast, a wagon load of
Pochards has been taken at one drop of the net.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The market of Philadelphia is very plentifully
supplied both with Canvas-backs and Red-heads
during the latter part of autumn and the winter.
The price of the former varies from a dollar and a
quarter per brace to three dollars. The latter seldom
bring more than one dollar. All the hotels of
note treat their guests frequently to Canvas-backs
during the season; and private parties, where luxury
is specially consulted, generally have the entertainment
graced by a course of this highly valued game.
European epicures have long envied the Americans
the possession of this splendid bird; but lately the
rapid intercourse by steamers between this country
has enabled the <span class='it'>bon vivant</span> of London and Paris to
enjoy the envied American luxury at home. Queen
Victoria, we are informed, has tasted Canvas-backs
at her own board.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HARLEQUIN DUCK. (<span class='it'>Clangula Histrionica.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sub-genus, Clangula, embraces several species
of ducks, small in size, but very active. They are
found most abundantly in the northern parts of our
continent, only appearing in the Middle States of
the Union when they are driven from their habitations
by the ice. The general characters of the
sub-genus present a short and narrow bill; the
feathers on the scapulars produced, pointed and
apart from each other; the third quills passing over
the primaries in the closed wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first species which presents itself to our notice
is the common Golden Eye, known to many of our
gunners by the name of the Brass-Eyed Whistlers.
The latter name it derives from the noisy whistling
of its short wings, as it rises when flushed. It does
not appear to possess any audible voice, and never
utters a cry, or a quack, when disturbed. Easy of
approach, they are nevertheless exceedingly difficult
to kill, as they dive with such dexterity at the flash
of a gun, or the twang of a bow, as to set at defiance
the Aborigines, who have ascribed to them supernatural
powers, and named them the Conjuring, or
Spirit Duck. The Golden Eye has been the subject
of much diversity of opinion among naturalists,
and we therefore the more readily give place to
Wilson’s accurate description of his plumage.
The Golden Eye is nineteen inches long, and twenty-nine
inches in extent, and weighs, on an average,
about two pounds; the bill is black, short, rising
considerably up in the forehead; the plumage of the
head, and part of the neck, is somewhat humid, and
of a dark green, with violet reflections, marked near
the corner of the mouth with an oval spot of white;
the irides are golden-yellow; rest of the neck, breast,
and whole lower parts, white, except the flanks,
which are dusky; back and wings, black; over the
latter, a broad bed of white extends from the middle
of the lesser coverts to the extremity of the secondaries;
the exterior scapulars are also white; tail,
hoary brown; tail-coverts, black; legs and toes,
reddish-orange, webs very large, and of a dark
purplish-brown; hind toe, and exterior edge of the
inner one, broadly finned; sides of the bill, obliquely
dentated; tongue covered above with a fine, thick,
velvety down, of a whitish color. The full plumaged
female is seventeen inches in length, and twenty
seven inches in extent; bill, brown, orange near
the tip; head, and part of the neck, brown, or very
dark drab, bounded below by a ring of white, below
that the neck is ash, tipped with white; rest of the
lower part, white; wings dusky, six of the secondaries
and their greater coverts, pure white, except
the tips of the last, which are touched with dusky
spots; rest of the wing coverts sinereous, mixed
with whitish; back and scapulars, dusky, tipped
with brown; feet, dull orange; across the vent a
band of sinereous; tongue, covered with the same
velvety down as the male. The young birds of the
first season very much resemble the females, but
may generally be distinguished by the white spot,
or at least its rudiments, which marks the corner of
the mouth, yet in some cases even this is variable,
both old and young male birds occasionally wanting
the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its flesh is well flavored, and it is equally common,
in the winter season, in all the coasts of the United
States. It is essentially a water bird, and walks
with extreme difficulty. The birds known in the
Carolinas by the name of Dippers, and in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey by the appellation of Butter
Box, belong to the Clangula, and are known by
the specific name of Spirit Ducks, which they have
acquired by successful evasions of the bullet and
the arrow. They are even more difficult to bag
than the Golden Eye, for when wounded with shot,
they conceal themselves with great art beneath the
water, remaining submerged to the bill until they
fall into the jaws of a hungry pike, or are abandoned
by the disappointed sportsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the Clangulas, however, the most rare and
most valued is the beautiful species whose representation
we have given above. It is not unfrequently
found off the coasts of New England, where
the elegant crescents and circles of white which
ornament its neck and breast have gained for it the
proud title of The Lord, and, on the shores of Hudson’s
Bay, the Painted Duck. It swims and dives
well, has a whistling note, flies swift and to a great
height, but always takes to the water on the report
of a gun, as its most secure and natural element.
Its flesh is extremely good, far superior, as game, to
the Wild Duck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Used to be—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have, as a general rule, an aversion to this
species of qualifying phraseology, in which so many
are prone to indulge. It seems to argue a disposition
like to that of Iago, who “was nothing if not
critical;” and it indicates a tendency to spy out
flaws and to look after defect—a disposition and a
tendency at war, we think, with that rational
scheme of happiness which derives its comfort
from the reflection of the sunny side of things. “It
was”—“she has been”—“he used to be”—and so
forth, as if all merit were a reminiscence—if not
past, at least passing away. Is that a pleasure?
Would it not be quite as well to applaud the present
aspect, and to be satisfied with the existing circumstance,
instead of murmuring over the fact that once
it was brighter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But yet there is a difference⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes—decidedly—the matter here is beyond the
possibility of a dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a difference—lamentable enough you
may term it, between the Singleton Snippe that was,
and the Singleton Snippe that is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Singleton Snippe that was, is not now an
existence; and the probabilities are that he never
will be again. Nothing is stable in this world but
instability; and the livery-stable of to-day is converted
into something else on the morrow, never
more to be a stable, unstable stable. And so with
men as well as with horses—for this perpetual revolution
of human affairs goeth not backwards, except
when the rope breaks on an inclined plane, making
it a down-hill sort of a business. Snippe is on the
down-hill—rather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Singleton Snippe that is, stands picturesquely
and pictorially before you—patiently, as it were,
and on a monument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, was there ever—we ask the question
of those who remember Snippe in his primitive and
natural state—was there ever a merrier fellow than
the said Singleton Snippe, in the original, if we may
term it so—before the said Singleton was translated
into his present condition, and became tamed down
from his erratic, independent eccentricities to the
patient tolerance of the band-box and the bundle?
Who, thus remembering and thus contrasting Singleton
Snippe as he was, with the Singleton Snippe
as he is now portrayed, could possibly believe that
there are processes in life—chemistries and alchemies—which
could bring the man of to-day so diametrically
opposite to the same man of yesterday;
and cause the Singleton Snippe of the past to differ
with such strangeness from the Singleton Snippe of
the current era? Two Snippes, as plain as may
be; but legally and responsibly the same Snippe.
There was Snippe the bold—Snippe the reckless—Snippe
the gay and hilarious—scoffing, joking, jeering
Snippe—Snippe that was always on hand for
mischief or for fun—Snippe, with the cigar in his
mouth, or the champagne glass in his grasp—yes,
that very Snippe whom you have so often heard in
the street, disturbing slumber by the loud and musical
avowal of his deliberate determination not to
“go home till morning,” as if it would, barring the
advantage of the daylight, be any easier to him
then, and whose existence was ever a scene of uproar
and jollity, except in the repentant intervals of
headache and exhaustion. And then, besides his
ornamental purposes, he was such a useful member
of society, this Singleton Snippe, in the consumption
of the good things of this life at the restaurants
and in the oyster saloons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was not that a Snippe—something like a Snippe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas for Snippe, the last representative of the
illustrious firm of “Tom &amp; Jerry.” Who is there
now—now that Snippe is withdrawn as a partner
from the establishment—to maintain the credit of
the house? Snippe is snubbed—snubbed is Snippe.
Well, well, well—let the watchmen—sweet voices
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
of the night—rejoice in their boxes, if they will,
over their pine kindlings, and their hot sheet-iron
stoves—rejoice in their cosy slumbers, that the
original Snippe no longer molests their ancient,
solitary reign, by uncouth noises, preliminary, symphonious,
and symptomatic to a row. And let the
cabmen—want a cab, sir?—be merry, too, with rein
in hand, or reclining against the friendly wall, that
they are no more to be victimized by the practical
jocularities of the school of Singleton Snippe. What
relish have they for the gracefulnesses of existence—its
little playful embellishments, that bead and
dimple the dull surface of the pond into the varieties
of playful fantasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such as these would describe a boy of the superlative
order of merit, as “one that goes straight home
and never stops to play on the road;” and we all
know that Singleton Snippe never went straight
home in the whole course of his experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Home!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Home, it should be understood, so much vaunted
by the poets, and so greatly delighted in by the antipodes
to Snippe, is regarded in quite a different
light—humdrummish—by the disciples of Snippeism.
Home, according to them, is not so much a spot to
retire to, as a place to escape from—a centre of
rendezvous, no doubt, with the washerwoman, the
bootblack, and other indispensable people of that
sort. Snippe’s new clothes were always sent home;
and long bills, provocative of long faces, were apt
to follow them with the certainty of cause and
effect. But to stay at home himself—what—Snippe?—He
stay at home? He was called for occasionally
at that point—his breakfast was taken there, when
any degree of appetite remained from the preceding
night; and a note would eventually reach its destination
if left for him there. But it required a very
unusual conjunction of circumstances to find Singleton
Snippe at home more frequently than could be
helped. Home, in Snippe’s estimation, was the embodiment
of a yawn—he never heard of it without
the most extended of gapes. He could not speak
of it without opening his mouth to the extent of its
volume; and Snippe’s mouth is not a diamond edition,
but rather an octavo, if not rising to the dignity
of a quarto, at least when he is drinking. “Home!”
said he; “home’s a bore. What fun is there at
home, except dozing over the fire, or snoring on a
sofa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Home, indeed!—Talk to Snippe about staying at
home, if you would risk a home-icide. To be sure,
when too ill to run about, Singleton Snippe remained
unwillingly at home, as if it were a hospital;
and he staid at home once for the space of an evening,
merely to try the experiment, when he was in
health; but before he went to bed, Snippe had
thoughts of sending for the Coroner, to sit upon his
body, but changed his mind and brewed a jorum of
punch, which, after he had shod the cat with walnut
shells, somewhat reconciled him to the monotone
of domestic enjoyment. But Snippe never stayed
at home again, not he. Home is where the heart
is; and Snippe’s heart was a traveler—a locomotive
heart, perambulating; and it had no tendencies toward
circumscription and confine. That put him
out of heart altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherever any thing was going on—“a fight or
a foot-race,” according to popular phraseology, which
thus distinguishes the desirable in the shape of spectacular
entertainment—there was Snippe, with his
hat set knowingly on one side, to indicate that
if others felt out of their element on the occasion, he,
Snippe, was perfectly at home under all circumstances—the
more at home, the more singular the
occasion, and the more strange the circumstance;
and his hat was the more knowingly set on to indicate
the extent of his superiority to vulgar prejudices.
It was the hat of a practical philosopher—of
a thorough bred man of the world, who could
extract sport from any thing, and who did not care,
so that the occurrence afforded excitement, whether
other people thought it reprehensible or not. Yes,
yes—there is much in a hat—talk of your physiognomy
and your phrenology—what are they as indications
of character, feeling, and disposition, compared
to the “set” of one’s beaver? Look at courage,
will you, with its hat drawn resolutely down upon
its determined brow. Dare you dispute the way
with such a hat as that? The meek one and the
lowly, with his hat placed timidly on the back of
his head, does not every bully practice imposition
there? Hats turned up behind, indicate a scornful
indifference to public opinion in all its phases—say
what you will, who cares? While the hat turned up
before, has in it a generous confidence, free from
suspicion of contempt. Nay, more—when science
has made a further progress, why should not the
expression of the hat afford knowledge of the passing
mood of mind in its wearer, the hat shifting and
changing in position as the brain beneath forms new
combinations of thought? Let the shop-boy answer;
does he not discover at a glance, from the style in
which his master wears his hat at the moment,
whether he, the subordinate, is to be greeted with
scoldings and reproaches, or with commendations
and applause? Does not the hat paternal forbode
the sunshine or the storm; and as the pedagogue
approaches school, where is the trembling truant
who does not discern “the morn’s disaster” from
the cocking of that awful hat? There cannot be a
doubt of it. The science of the hat yet remains to
be developed; and deep down in the realms of
ignorance are they who have not reflected yet upon
the clue afforded by the hat to what is passing in
the soul of him who wears it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, you could distinguish Singleton Snippe’s hat
at a horse-race, at a riot, or at a fire—equally delighted
was that hat at every species of uproar—in
the street—the lobby—the bar-room, or wherever
else that hat could spy out “fun,” the great staple
of its existence, with this advantage, that it had an
instinct of peril, and could extricate itself from
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
danger without the slightest ruffling of its fur.
Snippe was wise—Snippe preferred that all detriments
should fall to the share of others, while the
joke remained with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at last, a change reached even unto the hat
of Snippe—change comes to all; a change, singularly
enough, that took all other change from the
pockets of Snippe. He was obliged to discover that
the mere entertainments of life are not a commodity
to live upon, and that however pleasant it may be
to amuse one’s self, the profits therefrom accruing,
do not furnish continued means of delectation and
delight. Snippe neglected his business, and consequently,
his business, with a perversity peculiar
to business, neglected Snippe—so that Snippe and
Snippe’s business had a falling out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will never do,” declared Snippe, after deep
reflection on the subject of ways and means—“never
do in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But yet it did do—did do for Singleton Snippe,
and effectually broke him up in the mercantile way,
which involved all other ways; and so Mr. Snippe
resolved to make the most available market that
presented itself for the retrieval of past error.
Snippe resolved to marry—advantageously, of
course. Snippe was not poetical—he had no vein
of romance in his constitution; he could live very
well by himself, if he only had the means for that
purpose; but not having the means, unfortunate
Snippe, he determined to live by somebody else,
living of some sort being a matter of necessity in
Snippe’s estimation, though no other person could
discover what necessity there was for the living of
Snippe. The world might revolve without a Snippe;
and affairs generally would work smoothly enough,
even if he were not present. Snippe labored under
a delusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still—not having much of philosophy in his
composition to enable him to discover that, so for as
the general economy of the universe is concerned,
it was no matter whether Singleton Snippe obtained
a living or not; and lacking the desire, if not also
the ability, to work out that living by his own
energies of head and hands, Snippe, according to
his own theory, having too much of proper pride
and of commendable self-respect to engage in toil,
though some of the unenlightened gave it the less
respectful designation of laziness, which, perhaps, is
a nearer relative to the pride of the Snippes than is
generally supposed—Snippe, as already intimated,
made up his mind to marry as aforesaid—upon the
mercantile principle—bartering Snippe as a valuable
commodity, (without regard to the penal enactments
against obtaining goods on false pretences) for a
certain share of boarding and lodging, and of the
other appliances required for the outfit and the
sustenance of a gentleman of wit and leisure about
town—Snippe offered to the highest bidder—Snippe
put up, and Snippe knocked down—going—gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now although there are many who would not
have had Singleton Snippe about the premises, even
as a gift, and would have rejected him had he been
offered as a Christmas-box, yet there was a rich
widow, having the experience of three or four
husbands, who did not hesitate on the experiment
of endeavoring to fashion our Snippe into the shape
and form of a good and an available husband. Mrs.
Dawkins was fully aware of the nature of his past
life, and of the peculiarities of his present position.
She likewise formed a shrewd guess as to the
reasons which impelled him to seek her well-filled
hand, and to sigh after her plethoric purse—Snippe
in search of a living; but confident in her own skill—justly
confident, as was proved by the result—to
reduce the most rebellious into a proper state of
submissiveness and docility, she yielded her blushing
assent to become the blooming bride of Singleton
Snippe, and to undertake the government of that
insubordinate province, the state of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall marry Mrs. Dawkins,” thought Snippe;
but, alas! how mistakenly; “I shall marry her,”
repeated he, “and, for a week or two, I’ll be as quiet
as a lamb, sitting there by the fire a twiddling of
my thumbs, and saying all sorts of sweet things
about ‘lovey,’ and ‘ducky,’ and so forth. But as
soon after that as possible, when I’ve found out how
to get at the cash, then Mrs. Dawkins may make up
her mind to be astonished a little. That dining-room
of hers will do nice for suppers and card parties,
and punch and cigars—we’ll have roaring times in
that room, mind I tell you we will. I’ll have four
dogs in the yard—two pinters, a poodle, and a
setter; and they shall come into the parlor to sleep
on the rug, and to hunt the cat whenever they want
to. A couple of horses besides—I can’t do without
horses—a fast trotter, for fun, and a pacer, for exercise;
and a great many more things, which I can’t
remember now. But Mrs. Dawkins has a deal to
learn, I can tell her. There’s nothing humdrum
about Singleton Snippe; and if she did henpeck my
illustrious predecessors, she has got to find the
difference in my case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Snippe emphasized his hat plump upon his
brow, and looked like the individual, not Franklin,
that defied the lightning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall marry Singleton Snippe,” also soliloquized
Mrs. Dawkins, “who is described to me as
one of the wildest of colts, and as being only in pursuit
of my money. Well, I’m not afraid. A husband
is a very convenient article to have about the
house—to run errands, to call the coach, to quarrel
with work-people, and to accompany me on my
visits. Everybody ought to have a husband to complete
the furniture; and as for his being a wild colt,
as Mrs. Brummagem says, I should like to see the
husband of mine who will venture to be disobedient
to my will when he has to come to me for every
thing he wants. I’ll teach Mr. Singleton Snippe to
know his place in less than a week, or else Mr.
Singleton Snippe is a very different person from
the generality of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Singleton Snippe and Mrs. Dorothea Dawkins
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
became one, on the programme above specified;
and thus Mr. Singleton Snippe, whose last dollar
was exhausted in the marriage fee, was enabled to
obtain a living. Poor Snippe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glance, with tear in eye, if tears you have, at the
portrait of the parties now first laid before the public—note
it in your books, how sadly Singleton Snippe
is metamorphosed from the untamed aspect that
formerly distinguished him in the walks of men,
and tell us whether Driesbach, Van Amburg, or
Carter, ever effected a revolution so great as we
find here presented. Observe the bandbox, and regard
the umbrell’—see—above all—see how curiously
and how securely Singleton Snippe’s hand
is enfolded in that of Mrs. Singleton Snippe, that
she may be sure of him, and that he may not slip
from her side, and relapse into former habits—“safe
bind, safe find,” is the matrimonial motto of Mrs.
Singleton Snippe. Moreover, in vindication of our
favorite theory of the expression of the beaver, mark
ye the drooping aspect of Snippe’s chapeau, as if
it had been placed there by Mrs. Snippe herself, to
suit her own fancy, and to avoid the daring look of
bachelor, which is her especial detestation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snippe is subdued—a child might safely play with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, curious psychologist and careful commentator
on the world, would ye learn how results
apparently so miraculous, were effected and brought
about? Read, then, and be wiser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snippe has his living, for he is living yet, though
he scarcely calls it living—but Mrs. Snippe firmly
holds the key of the strong-box, and thus grasps the
reins of authority. The Snippes are tamed as lions
are—by the mollifying and reducing result of the
system of short allowances. Wonderful are the
effects thereof, triumphant over Snippes—no suppers,
no cards, no punches, and no cigars. The dogs
retreated before judicious applications of the broom-handle;
and it was found a matter of impossibility
to trot those horses up—the arm of cavalry formed
no branch in the services of Singleton Snippe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Foiled at other points, Mr. Snippe thought that
he might at least be able to disport himself in the
old routine, and to roam abroad with full pockets in
the vivacious field of former exploit; and he endeavored
one evening silently to reach his hat and
coat, and to glide away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, hey!—what’s that?—where, allow me to
ask, are you going at this time of night, Mr. Snippe?”
cried his lady in notes of ominous sharpness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out,” responded Snippe, with a heart-broken
expression, like an afflicted mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out, indeed!—where’s out, I’d like to know?—where’s
out, that you prefer it to the comfortable
pleasures of your own fireside?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out is nowhere’s in particular, but everywhere’s
in general, to see what’s going on. Everybody goes
out, Mrs. Snippe, after tea, they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Snippe, everybody don’t—do I go out,
Mr. Snippe, without being able to say where I am
going to? No, Mr. Snippe, you are not going out
to frolic, and smoke, and drink, and riot round,
upon my money. If you go out, I’ll go out too.
But you’re not going out. Give me that hat, Mr.
Snippe, and do you sit down there, quietly, like a
sober, respectable man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, Mr. Snippe’s hat—wonder not at its dejection—was
securely placed every evening under
Mrs. Snippe’s most watchful eye; and Mr. Snippe,
after a few unavailing efforts to the contrary, was
compelled to yield the point, to stay quietly at
home, his peculiar detestation, and to nurse the
lap-dog, and to cherish the cat, instead of bringing
poodle and setter into the drawing-room to discontent
the feline favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want a little money, Mrs. Snippe, if you please—some
change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, pray, allow me to ask what you want it for,
Mr. Snippe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To pay for things, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Snippe, I tell you once for all, I’m not going
to nurture you in your extravagance, I’m not.
Money, indeed!—don’t I give you all you wish to
eat, and all you want to wear? Let your bills be
sent to me, Mr. Snippe, and I’ll save you all trouble
on that score. What use have you for money?
No, no—husbands are always extravagant, and
should never be trusted with money. My money,
Mr. Snippe—mine—jingling in your pockets, would
only tempt you to your old follies, and lead you
again to your worthless companions. I know well
that husbands with money are never to be trusted
out of one’s sight—never. I’ll take better care of
you than that, Mr. Snippe, I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Singleton Snippe ever did escape, he was
forthwith brought to the confessional, to give a full
and faithful account of all that had occurred during
his absence—where he had been—whom he had
seen—what he had done, and every thing that had
been said, eliciting remarks thereon, critical and
hypercritical, from his careful guardian; and so also,
when a little cash did come into his possession, he
was compelled to produce it, and to account for
every deficient cent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder, then, that Singleton Snippe underwent</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was several days after the events of the last
chapter, and the scene was one of wild and woodland
beauty. Huge cypresses rose on every hand,
festooned with parasite plants; broad glades opened
here and there in all directions; and vast arcades
stretched off in the distance, groined and vaulted
like a Gothic minster. It was just such a spot as
Robin Hood might have chosen in old Sherwood.
Here were gnarled monarchs of the forest which had
braved the lightnings and the storms of a thousand
years: here were natural bowers, formed by the
interlacing branches of the trees, such as fair Rosamond
might have been sheltered in: here were
vines, drooping from the huge branches, like curtains,
or hanging in festoons across the way, like
the draped banners of a mighty host. The whole
scene was full of picturesque beauty. And the
effect was heightened by fires, which, glimmering
here and there between the trees, cast wild and
flickering shades along the sward, and gave the
prospect the air of an enchanted forest. Fragrant
plants filled the evening atmosphere with delicious
perfume—the laurel, the shrub, and, more exquisite
than all, the sweet-scented jessamine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, as the reader may have imagined, was
Marion’s celebrated camp at Snow Island. It was
a piece of high river swamp, nearly altogether enclosed
by water, and defended by its natural position
from surprise and siege alike. Here, after his
famous expeditions, he was accustomed to retire
and recruit his men, exhausted by the long and
rapid marches, often sixty miles a day, which they
had been called on to endure. Perhaps the great
secret of this renowned partisan’s success, next to
his indomitable courage, which reminds us of that
of a knight of chivalry, was the care which he took
to give his followers sufficient rest between his enterprises.
His maxim was to lie low and feed high
until the hour came to strike; but then his motions
were as rapid, and the blow he struck as decisive
as the thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present occasion was one of those on which
his men, having returned from a successful expedition,
were resigning themselves, like true soldiers,
to the pleasure of the moment. The sentinels were
indeed posted at the outskirts: but inside the camp
itself was universal wassail and song. The reins
of discipline seemed, for the time, to have been relaxed.
The different messes were gathered together
over their meals: the cheerful cup circulated
from hand to hand: and many a merry jest was
told, or lyric of war or love was sung by those jovial
boon companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these groups seemed even more merry
than the rest. It was composed of about a dozen
men, prominent among whom was Preston’s serjeant,
Macdonald, who acted as the director of ceremonies
for the time being, and saw especially to the
circulation of the cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it up, boys.” he said, handing around the
bottle, “it isn’t often we get such real old stuff as
this, for it’s not every day we have the rifling of a
rich Tory’s cellars, as we had last week. A short
life and a merry one, is my motto. Hillo! my excellent
friend, Jacob, why don’t you drink? You
needn’t sit showing us your teeth all the time,
though they are so handsome. Comrades, here’s
the health of Jacob Snow—that’s you, my old chap,
I suppose—he serves as pretty a mistress as there
is in the thirteen colonies, and boasts a shin-bone
that curves like a reaping-hook. Jacob Snow, standing,
egad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor, Massa Macdonald, I’m deeply obligated
for dis honor,” said the old butler, for it was indeed
he. “I am discumfounded for words to distress
my feelings.” Here he laid his hand on his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it—blaze away, old fellow,” said the serjeant,
slapping him on the back, “I knew you could
talk as glib as a parson. So you were at Mrs.
Blakeley’s when we were before that place, were
you? You remember my sending in for my baggage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gor Amighty, yes!” said old Jacob, full of reverential
admiration. “And you’se de gentleman too
dat shot Lieut. Torriano at three hundred yards.
Yaw! yaw! yaw! dat made ’em furious. Major
Lindsay said you were an Injun, and no better dan
a cannon-ball—he, yaw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha! A cannibal, you mean, my old brave, I
suppose. But that hitting of the lieutenant was a
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
trifle to the way I served Major Gainey. Wasn’t
it, lads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, was it!” echoed half a dozen voices, “Tell
it to him—tell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I?” said the serjeant, addressing Jacob
with something of drunken gravity; for the whole
party, by this time, had done ample justice to their
flagons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Jacob nodded, and Macdonald begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, you must know, my jolly old blade—but
fill your cup again, and drink perdition to the
Englishmen—that a party of us had a brush down
by Georgetown, not long ago, with some of the
British regulars, who were killing beeves at White’s
Bridge. We soon whipped the red-coats, and then
chased them toward the town. But their friends
there, hearing the firing, came swarming out like
bees, and so we went at it again, hip and thigh as
the good book says, and for a while it was the toss
of a sixpence which should win. We fought a
pretty smart bit of the day: but at last the red-coats
gave ground again. I had noticed among them an
officer whom I took for Major Gainey, a fellow that
had the impudence to boast he’d carry Marion a
prisoner on his saddle into Georgetown: and so I
singled him out, resolving to try his pluck, and comb
him down a spell. But no sooner did he see me,
coming down on Black Bess, than he clapped spurs
to his horse—and a cursedly good one it was—and
made straight for the town, like an old woman who
sees a mad-dog. Down the road we went, clattering
and thundering; but devil a bit for a long while
could I gain on the major. I might have cut down
half a dozen strapping fellows as I dashed along,
but I had made up my mind to have nothing short
of the leader himself. Old Black Bess did wonders
that day! The trees and fences shot past, as if running
a race. The major’s blooded horse went as I
never saw a beast go before, but I was close behind,
and beginning to gain on him. We were now
almost at the entrance of Georgetown. Still I held
on, whooping to old Bess like a mad devil, as I was.
Just as I reached Richmond fence, I lapped the
quarter of the major’s horse, and with a lunge ran
my bayonet into his back. The major had turned
around, frightened half to death, lifting up his hands
beseechingly; and I thought I had him sure, till the
cursed bayonet came off, and left me only the gun.
I was mad enough at having lost him, yet I could
not help laughing as I saw him go down the streets
of Georgetown, the bayonet still sticking in him,
like a skewer into a trussed fowl. I hauled up, and
came off safe; and that’s the last we’ve heard of
Major Gainey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With narratives like these the night passed; the
old butler listening with open mouth and ears. At
length, toward midnight, the tread of a horse’s feet
was heard, and directly a clear, commanding voice
called Macdonald by name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain, by the Lord!” exclaimed the serjeant,
jumping up as if struck by an electric shock.
“Here he is at last, alive and sound, which I began
to fear for—Huzza! But stop. Now, Jacob Snow,
Esq., deliver your mission. Stand up like a man,
as I do, and don’t sway about like a pine tree in a
hurricane. Captain, this gentleman,” continued the
speaker, his voice getting thicker and thicker, “has
a message for you from Miss Mowbray, but he’s too
cursedly drunk to know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words our hero, who was regarding the
group with a look of silent rebuke, turned suddenly
on the old butler, who was, if truth must be told, the
only sober one of the party. A flash of joy lit up
Capt. Preston’s face as he extended his hand for
the supposed letter. Old Jacob, who had no missive
of that character to deliver, but who had come
wholly on his own responsibility, hesitated what to
say. While the two parties are thus regarding each
other, we will explain the incidents which had
brought them thus unexpectedly together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capt. Preston had found great difficulty in regaining
the camp, in consequence of Major Lindsay
having left word of the place, where he had sought
refuge, with some Tories in the neighborhood. These
men, anxious to secure so redoubtable a leader, had
immediately stationed patrols at all the usual outlets
of the swamp, and thus twice had our hero
been driven back into its recesses, once narrowly
escaping death. At length, however, in the dead of
night, he had succeeded in eluding his enemies, and
gained the high-road. His flight, however, had led
him into a district full of Tories, and he was forced
to travel with great caution, and make a long circuit,
in order to return to the camp. Meantime his
absence there had occasioned much alarm, especially
among his troop; and Macdonald had intended,
if he did not appear by the ensuing morning,
setting forth to make inquiries respecting him,
fearing he was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old butler had been in the camp two days.
He had attended his mistress to Georgetown, and
was the only one who suspected the true state of
Kate’s heart. He loved that fair creature with the
blind devotion a dog shows to its master; and he
had long been fully satisfied that her affections
were given to Preston. Of our hero he had some
such idea as the old romancers had of a Paladin of
former days, looking on him as capable of doing
any deed, no matter how impossible. To old Jacob
it seemed only necessary that Preston should know
of Kate’s danger, in order to rescue her. Accordingly,
when he found the marriage actually resolved
on, and the day fixed, he stole out of Georgetown,
and made the best of his way to Marion’s camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the news of Preston’s absence fell on him
like a thunderbolt. But he knew that no one else
could assist him; and moreover he held Kate’s
secret too sacred to be imparted to others. Meantime,
he found amusement in listening to the tales
of the soldiers, and he was never happier than
when, with mouth wide open, he sat devouring
some story of the war. He implicitly believed
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
every thing he heard, and thought with humble
vanity what a sensation he would create in the
kitchen at Blakeley Hall, when he rehearsed there
those tales; for Jacob, in his lowly way, was a
sort of Froissart, and, with the unctuous old canon,
thought nothing so “honorable and glorious as gallant
feats of arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preston now drew the butler aside, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you the letter here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, massa,” said the old fellow, determined
to blurt through the business with a round falsehood,
since he could think of nothing else just then that
would serve his turn, “Please, massa, dat was a
cursed lie in Sarjeant Macdonald—I nebber had a
letter from Miss Kate, but I hab one lily message
from her. She is in Georgetown, in a polemic—either
she must marry Major Lindsay, or Mr. Mowbray
be hung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” exclaimed Preston, “What is it you
say? Trifle not with me,” he said sternly, seizing
the slave by the collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As true as dare is a heaven above,” said the
old butler trembling, and half frightened out of his
wits; “what I say is de Gospel truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then proceeded to give Preston a more detailed
account of affairs, so far as they were known
to him, adhering generally to the truth, except in
roundly asserting that Kate had sent him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preston’s heart throbbed when he heard this.
Kate loved him, then, after all. Hope whispered to
him a bewildering dream; for if she could be rescued,
what happiness might be his. But then came the
thought—how was this to be effected? Kate was at
Georgetown, a post of considerable strength, and no
succor could reach her, unless by stratagem; yet
with time this might be effected. But in what manner
could the vigilance of guards be surmounted, and
the prizes carried off—for it was necessary to
rescue her father as well as herself? Suddenly the
voice of old Jacob aroused him from the train of
thought into which he was plunged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dere is lily time left, sar,” he said, “for I hab
waited here two days. To-morrow night it will be
too late, for den de wedding is to take place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow night!” said Preston aghast—for
now he heard, for the first time, of the period fixed
for the marriage. “God of heaven! it is already too
late—she is lost for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his face, tortured with anguish, up to
the moon, which was sailing, full and bright, through
the blue depths of air. How calm and unruffled was
that silvery planet? Ages ago it had shown thus,
equally cold and unsympathizing. It had seen the
sacrifice of Jeptha’s daughter; it had beheld the
fugitive Pompey; it had gazed on Zenobia, when
a crownless queen; it had looked down on pestilence,
and war, and human misery in every shape—and
still it held on its course, the same cold, unfeeling
orb, mocking at man and his agony. Preston
turned away and groaned. Heaven as well as
earth seemed without hope.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>We left Preston tortured with the reflection that
the news of Kate’s peril had come too late. Half
insane with the thought, he strode to and fro in his
marquee. Suddenly an orderly appeared at the
door and requested our hero’s presence at headquarters,
where a council of officers was to be immediately
held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering what enterprise called them together,
and fearful lest duty should prevent his obtaining
the furlough which he intended to ask, in order that
he might save Kate, or at least die in the attempt,
he walked moodily to the tent of Marion. Here he
found the leading captains of the brigade already
assembled, late as was the hour; and beside them,
Col. Lee, who had just joined Marion with his legion,
subsequently so celebrated in that partisan war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe Capt. Preston is the last one expected—I
am glad to see him safely returned,” said
Marion, when our hero, having bowed to his brother
officers, had assumed a seat, “and, as the affair on
which we have met is urgent, we will proceed at
once to business. Capt. Horry, will you state the
purpose of this assembly; after that we will listen
to you all, beginning with Capt. Preston, who is the
youngest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every eye, as he spoke, had been turned on
Marion; and as hitherto we have given no description
of this celebrated personage, we will employ
the interval in drawing his picture. Marion, at that
time, was about forty-eight years old; small of
stature, swarthy in visage, and having a face crossed
by many lines of thought. Without being positively
stern in aspect, there was a hard expression in his
countenance, which at first might seem to augur a
bosom equally hard; but Marion was, in reality, a
man of a singularly mild temperament; and the
usually passionless expression of his face arose
rather from the firmness of his character, and the
responsibilities of his station, than from any lack of
human sympathy. His eyes were dark, small, and
piercing; but at times they kindled with enthusiasm.
This, indeed, was the only evidence that a physiognomist
could have found of genius in Marion;
but when those eyes flashed indignantly at wrong,
blind, indeed, must he have been, who did not see
the master-spirit within. In attire, this great partisan
leader was simple and modest. His words
generally were few; and, after the exertion he made
in welcoming Preston, he sank back into a silence
which he maintained until the conference was
breaking up, only, as each officer delivered his
opinion, Marion would cast on him a momentary
glance, as if to read his soul, and then sink his head
on his breast, thoughtful and abstracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few words Capt. Horry explained the purpose
for which the council had been convened. A
spy had just come in with the intelligence that the
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
garrison of Georgetown had been considerably reduced;
on which Col. Lee had proposed that an
attack should be made upon the place, since the
country expected some bold and decisive stroke,
now that his forces and Marion’s were united. The
plan he suggested was, that a portion of the brigade
should drop down the Pedee by night, and lie in
ambush below the town; that, on the succeeding
night, this party should enter the town on that defenceless
side, and taking it by surprise, open an
entrance for their comrades, who, led by Lee and
Marion in person, would be ready, at the signal, to
assail the entrenchments on the landward side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heart of Preston leaped into his throat as he
heard this proposal “Perhaps Kate may yet be
saved,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, when Horry ceased, and Marion, by
a nod, signified his desire for our hero to speak,
Preston’s eyes kindled, and he answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My voice is for the attack, whatever be the
odds. The opportunity for a bold, a resolute assault,
is all I ask for. We will die to a man, or succeed.
I will undertake, if necessary, to charge with my
company up to the very muzzles of the battery
which defends the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lee turned to Horry and nodded approvingly at
these words. “A lad of spirit,” he whispered apart.
“I have heard of his daring at Blakeley’s. Had
there been more such at Camden, we never would
have lost that day.” Marion, however, took no
further notice of Preston’s fiery speech than to turn
to the next officer at the table; but a very close observer
might have detected a sudden gleam of the
general’s eye, like a flash, gone in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opinions of the other officers were in the
main less favorable to the enterprise than Preston’s;
and so many obstacles were mentioned as necessary
to overcome, that he was in torture lest the
undertaking should be abandoned. Even Lee
seemed to hesitate, startled at the difficulties brought
forward. Had military discipline permitted it, Preston
would have broken in on the conference; but
he was forced to sit silent, hearing obstacle after obstacle
canvassed as unconquerable; yet his flashing
eye, and the agitation of his countenance, told how
difficult it was to restrain himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length all had delivered their opinions except
Marion. He glanced around the board before he
spoke, and his words fell on a breathless auditory.
With Preston the excitement was intense to hear
the general’s decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find,” said Marion, “that I am in the minority
here; and that, except Col. Lee, and Captains Horry
and Preston, I am almost alone. I do not go quite
so far as these two latter, however, in considering
the enterprise as certain of success, but I think it
affords a fair chance—and bravery can do the rest.
Besides, gentlemen,” said he solemnly, “you know
it was in an attempt on Georgetown that my nephew
lost his life; and you all know, too, that I have sworn
to avenge him. I have not forgotten my vow.
Before God, he shall be avenged before to-morrow
night is past. This very night a part of the troops
shall set forth.” With these words he rose and dismissed
the council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every heart was now alive for the enterprise.
The memory of the outrage alluded to strung
all to a pitch of indignation little short of frenzy.
The <a id='word'></a>watchword, “The Oath of Marion!” was
adopted by general consent, and passed from lip
to lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preston, it may well be supposed, was even more
excited than his commander. His only fear now
was that his succor would arrive too late. Agitated
by this thought, he tossed to and fro on his
couch, vainly seeking slumber. Many a muttered
imprecation left his lips on the villain who had destroyed
his happiness and that of Kate. Frequently
he half breathed aloud the wish that his enemy
was before him, man to man, with none to interfere
between him and his revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts mingled with his dreams, when,
exhausted by his agitation, he sunk finally into a
troubled and feverish slumber. Strange figures
hovered around his bed, and haunted his morbid
fancies. He imagined himself bound hand and foot,
while his enemy came to exult over him, leading
Kate by the hand, now a dejected, broken-hearted
creature, whom to look at made tears start to the
eyes. Then again she was seen, clothed in bridal
white, extended, like a human sacrifice, upon an
altar; while Major Lindsay, converted into a hideous
priest of Moloch, stood ready to plunge the knife
into her bosom. A third time he saw her, standing
before a clergyman, while the marriage ceremony
was performed between her and Major Lindsay;
he thrilled with ecstasy to find he was not too late,
and rushing forward to save her, the bridegroom
was <a id='sud'></a>suddenly transformed into a grinning fiend, and
she into a pale, cold corpse. Shivering with horror
he awoke, and started from his bed; nor was it until
he had passed his hand across his brow that the
ghastly vision faded entirely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his waking thoughts were scarcely less harrowing
than his dreams. Slowly the recollection
of Kate’s sacrifice, and his own unhappiness came
back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To learn that I am loved, yet perhaps too late,”
he murmured. “Why was I so proud when we
last met?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the reveille, however, summoned
him to his duty. On emerging from his marquee he
saw that the camp was already in motion. The
dragoons were rubbing their horses; the legion were
polishing their arms; officers were superintending
the mustering their several corps; and the whole
scene was alive with bustle and noise—the neighing
of steeds, and the voices of men mingling indiscriminately.
Almost the first person Preston met
was Serjeant Macdonald, dragging along the old
butler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you quite fit for duty, serjeant?” said Preston.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
“That was a bad example you set the men last
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The serjeant looked somewhat abashed, and he
stammered out his apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you see, captain, we had no work on our
hands, and the Jamaica was uncommon good. Besides,
we wished to do honor to this gentleman, Mr.
Snow, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Mr. Snow,” said old Jacob, drawing himself
up with dignity, “but Jacob Bakely, sar—massa gib
me his own name. Massa Cap’n Preston know dat
well enough,” and he bowed, but with a familiar
smile, to our hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember you well, Jacob,” said he, “but I
fear you do not find our quarters as comfortable as
those at Mrs. Blakeley’s. We set out, in less than
an hour, on a secret expedition, and perhaps you
had better return home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God, no, massa!” interrupted the old man
emphatically. “I volunteer sooner. Dis affair, I inspect,
hab someting to do wid sweet missus Kate;
and old Jacob will nebber desert her while he
can fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he does not even know how to wield a
sabre,” said Preston, turning to his serjeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! I’ve had him at the broadsword exercise
these two hours,” replied Macdonald, aside to
Preston. “He’s wonderfully quick, considerin’
he’s a nigger; and he strikes, too, like a sledge-hammer.
Besides, he’s red hot with courage just
now—a reg’lar black lobster boiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preston smiled. He saw that the whole matter
had been arranged between the two confederates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since you are bent on trying a short campaign
with us,” he said, “I shall make no objection.
Only, if you are killed, what am I to say to your
mistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Jacob looked aghast at the bare supposition,
but he quickly rallied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nebber fear dat,” he replied grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” replied Macdonald, “it would take
a saw-mill to cut through your skull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My skull is not so tick as you tink, Massa Macdonald,”
replied old Jacob, tartly, turning on the
serjeant, “I hab you know dat, sar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Preston, laughing, “no time is to be
lost. Get ready at once to start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The serjeant accordingly dragged off the volunteer,
saying, good humoredly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep close to me when we charge, and put all
your muscle into every blow you make. You’ve
one excellent quality, let me tell you, without flattery—you
hate those English damnably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sartain, sar,” said old Jacob, making a full stop
until he delivered himself of his speech. “Dey are
good looking offisur enough; but, sar, dey tink Jacob
Bakely no more dan a hoss. It’s Jacob here, and
Jacob dare—and de best of missus wine at dat.
Dey tink nobody gemman but darselves. I’se show
’em dare mistake. Lor’ A’mighty, sar, I extinguish
dem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evening. In a large and spacious apartment,
elegantly wainscoted, and filled with rich
furniture, an innumerable number of lights were
blazing, as if the room was shortly to witness a festival.
Disposed about, on little exquisitely lacquered
Chinese stands, were vases filled with flowers, most
of them white. A rich Prayer-book lay open on a
table at the head of the room. At the side a place
had been fitted up for an orchestra. These were
the preparations for the bridal of our heroine—strange
mockery!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the company began to gather. Among
numerous officers and other guests came Col.
Campbell, the commander of the post, little dreaming
of the tragedy in which unwittingly he was playing
so very prominent a part. He was followed by
Mr. Mowbray, accompanied by the groom. Major
Lindsay was dressed in uniform, but he wore a
white favor on his breast, and his sword-knot was of
snowy ribbon. He walked with a firm, proud step,
and looked around smiling. He knew that there
was scarcely a brother officer that did not envy him
the possession of his bride, and the consciousness of
this increased the exuberance of his spirits. The
prize he had so long struggled for was now about to
be won; and all regret at his conduct had long since
vanished. Gratified triumph was written on every
feature of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mowbray was attired with becoming elegance,
though the guests remarked that his dress
was almost too sad for a wedding. It might, indeed,
with almost equal propriety have been worn at
a funeral. The dress, in fact, was no bad type of
Mr. Mowbray’s feelings, and, perhaps, had been
chosen on that account. The truth was, that in
secret he could not reconcile himself to this union.
Though Kate herself, weeping on his bosom, had
declared she was ready to marry Major Lindsay,
and though Mrs. Blakeley, herself deceived, had
assured him that Kate’s agitation arose only from the
usual coyness of a maid, he could not expel from his
heart an uneasy fear lest Kate had consented to this
marriage only to save his life. Why else was she
so pale? Why were her spirits so high in company,
while she bore traces, as he thought, of tears in
secret? Only that morning he had caught her
weeping; and when he pressed to know the cause,
she declared she was merely nervous—an assertion
which Mrs. Blakeley corroborated. To purchase
life with her unhappiness, was what he could not
consent to; and but for her, the aged patriot, perhaps,
would have scorned to purchase it on any
terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
As we have said, therefore, a secret presentiment
filled Mr. Mowbray’s heart with sadness. Something
seemed to whisper to him that it was not yet
too late to draw back. He seemed, indeed, like one
going to a scaffold, rather than like the parent of a
bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly the bride entered, attended by her aunt,
and the daughter of one of the officers. Kate was
dressed in simple white, without a single ornament,
and every vestige of color had fled from her face,
which looked almost like snowy wax. Still, she
was wondrously beautiful. Even her deathly
pallor, so like that of a corpse, that some of the
females present actually shuddered and drew back
as she approached, could not entirely destroy the
effect of her surpassing figure, and the grace of every
movement. Yet she looked rather like a nun about
to take the veil than like a bride. Her smiles were
no longer at her command—for the near approach
of her doom had completely prostrated her. She
seemed now what she was—a victim wreathed for
the sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had sat in her room all that afternoon, in a
sort of stupor, her fingers convulsively clasping and
unclasping each other, and her eyes bent on the
floor listlessly. The going out and coming in of
her attendants attracted no attention. But she had
not shed a tear. The fountains of her eyes seemed
scorched up. When the time came to attire her for
the ceremony, they had to rouse her; and the vacant
gaze of inquiry she turned on the servant, made the
slave, for a moment, think her insane. But when
her aunt came in to superintend her toilet, she
seemed to revive, and with an effort rose from her
chair, and welcomed her with a smile—but one like
a sunbeam on a wintry day, cold, and shuddering to
look upon. From this moment, however, she was
more like herself, though at times the muscles of her
mouth would twitch convulsively. At other times
she would turn away her head, and an expression
of heart-breaking wo would then shoot across her
countenance; but, on meeting her aunt’s eye once
more, she would essay again to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments before the ceremony was to begin,
they left her alone for a moment. She was standing
before the mirror, and her eyes fell on the reflection
of her form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sacrifice will soon be complete,” she said
bitterly. “God forgive me—yet surely I am doing
right. Oh! that I could weep, but there is a load
here,” and she pressed both hands on her breast,
“that keeps back the tears. It is like burning fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who would have believed that this ghastly face
was the once radiant one of Kate Mowbray?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father stood near the door as she entered.
He was struck with the dry, stony expression of
her face, and started forward to her side. He spoke
in a whisper, but with startling earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I adjure you, my daughter,” he said, “tell me—are
you willing to go on with this matter? Say but
a word, and it shall be broken off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate lifted her eyes to his with a sudden movement,
and the glance they gave was full of unutterable
love. It was such, if we may say so without
presumption, as a martyred spirit might have turned
to heaven from the stake. It thrilled every nerve
in that father’s frame. That same sad, sweet smile,
too, was on her face, as she placed her hand in his,
and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it go on, dear father. I am only faint and
nervous. I shall soon be better.” Ay! better in the
grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His doubts were only half resolved, but he could
say no more, and together they advanced to the
temporary altar, where the bridegroom and priest
stood awaiting them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate felt a choking in the throat, as her eyes first
fell on Major Lindsay, and it seemed to her, for an
instant, as if her knees were failing her. But
she remembered that her father’s eyes were bent
anxiously on her, and from that moment there was
no longer any faltering on her part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buzz which attended her entrance had now
subsided, and a deep hush fell on the room. Every
ear was strained to catch the first sound of the
minister’s voice. A watch might have been heard
to tick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearly beloved,” began the minister, in the time-hallowed
form of the Episcopal church, “we are
gathered together here in the sight of God—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had proceeded thus far, when such a sudden
and startling burst of tumult arose from the distant
street, that he raised his eyes, with a look of alarm,
from his book. It was like the confused ringing of
bells, half-drowned in the shouts of people. All at
once the town-bell itself, close at hand, took up the
uproar, and its iron tongue was heard clanging
hurriedly and fiercely on the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The male part of the company sprang to
their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” said Col. Campbell, “can it be the town
on fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it goes, louder and louder,” exclaimed a
second; “it must be an insurrection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women now lent their shrieks to the tumult.
The officers, with their hands on their swords,
rushed toward the door. The divine had dropped
his Prayer-book, and his looks were full of inquiry
and astonishment. Kate, with a quick look of alarm,
shrank back to her father’s side. All was wonder,
terror, and dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uproar without increased. Louder and
fiercer the alarm-bell rang; steps were heard hurrying
to and fro; and at length distant shouts, mingled
with the report of fire-arms, came to the ear. Then
drums were heard beating hastily to arms, and at
this signal every military man present rushed out into
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not alarmed,” said the bridegroom, turning to
Kate, “it is only a false alarm, or a drunken
mutiny. I will soon be back!” and with these words
he sprang after his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
The females were now left alone, excepting
the minister and Mr. <a id='mow'></a>Mowbray. But the tumult was
obviously no trifling one. The shouts seemed to approach,
and grew louder; a rushing sound, as of an
advancing crowd, was heard; the rattle of fire-arms
was almost continual, and seemed closer at hand
each moment; and still louder, and more hurriedly,
the call to arms was beaten, while fiercer and
fiercer the alarm-bell, in its neighboring cupola,
clamored over the din. A broad light now gleamed
across the windows from the darkness outside, and
cries of terror were heard increasing every moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mowbray handed Kate to her aunt, and hurrying
to the casement flung it up. At this the confused
sounds without assumed more distinctness,
and grew louder. He looked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Marion and his men,” he cried exultingly.
“Hark! here they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wild cry at these words of promised deliverance,
Kate sprung to her father’s side and
looked out. At the lower end of the village one or
two houses were in flames, and their bright glare
lit up the otherwise black prospect. Close at hand,
and retreating toward her in disorder, was a company
of the royal soldiers, among whom she saw
the largest portion of the officers lately assembled
in that apartment. She could distinguish Colonel
Campbell and Major Lindsay among others, sword
in hand, endeavoring to rally the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But further down the street was a spectacle that
filled her bosom with the wildest and most tumultuous
joy. Here the way was blocked up, from
side to side, by a press of assailants, who wore the
uniform of Marion’s brigade, and who were advancing
with loud shouts, charging continually on
the retreating foe, whom they drove before them as
wolves drive frightened sheep. As the battle drew
nearer, she could distinguish the several war cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza for Marion—Remember his oath—Drive
on the dogs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were the shouts of the assailants, to which
the royal officers replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand fast for old England. Down with the
rebels. Stand fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the retreating fugitives rallied, and
made a stand. This was almost opposite the window
where Kate remained with her father, in spite
of the danger, chained, as if by fascination, to the
spot. A reinforcement of soldiers, at the same instant,
came running down the street, and their companions
parting right and left to make way for them,
they gained the front and threw in a withering
volley on the foe. These, not expecting such a
sudden check, fell into some disorder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now charge on the rascals,” cried a voice, and
Col. Campbell sprung to the van, waving his sword.
“Give them the bayonet, lads, and the field is ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The issue of the combat hung trembling in the
balance. The assailants showed signs of falling
back, and Kate’s tumultuous hopes died within her,
when suddenly the tramp of horses’ feet was heard,
and a body of cavalry came thundering up the street.
At their head, on a powerful charger, rode a form
that Kate instantly recognized, as the lurid light of
the distant fire played redly on it. Need we say it
was that of Preston? His uplifted sabre flashed in
the wild glare like a blood-red meteor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The oath of Marion,” he shouted, in a voice of
thunder. “Strike home for revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sudden apparition, and more than all that
stirring shout, seemed to infuse a strange and wild
frenzy into the assailants, so lately about to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The oath of Marion!” exclaimed a stalwart
figure at Preston’s side, as he smote a royal grenadier
to the earth with a single stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry was caught up by the crowd. “The
oath of Marion—the oath of Marion!” rung from a
hundred voices: and the assailants, with that cry,
rushed on the royal troops like an avalanche rushes
from the sky. But foremost of all rode Preston and
his serjeant, while their terror-struck enemies
around them went down, with every sweep of their
good swords, like grain on a harvest-field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The royal troops broke in every direction. The
officers, seeing resistance was vain before so headlong
a charge, turned also to seek safety in flight.
Col. Campbell, however, seemed disposed to stand
his ground, but Macdonald riding his powerful steed
against him bore him down, and the next instant
the commandant, to save his life, yielded himself a
prisoner. It was at this moment that Major Lindsay
saw, for the first time, the face of Preston. With
an oath, hissed between his teeth, he snatched a
fire-lock from a dead soldier beside him, and pointed
it at our hero, who, not perceiving him, would infallibly
have fallen, but that his name uttered in a
shriek by Kate arrested his ear, and turning he beheld
his enemy, who was almost in a line with the
window whence the warning had been heard. The
lightning that rives the oak is not quicker than was
the blow from Preston’s sabre. Down, right on the
head of his adversary, descended the heavy steel,
crashing through the skull as if it had been only so
much paper: and with that blow, the soul of the
villain and assassin went to his long account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate saw no more. She scarcely indeed saw
that. She only knew that her lover had been
warned in time, and had escaped; for her father
now drew her forcibly in, and shut the perilous
casement, around which the pistol balls were rattling
like hail. Then she swooned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of that night is matter of history. The
town was, for a while, wholly in the hands of the
assailants, and the victory would have been complete
but for some misapprehension in the hour at
which the different detachments were to attack,
which enabled a part of the enemy to gain their
garrison, where they were too strongly entrenched
to be taken without artillery. The assailants accordingly
retired after having captured the town
and made Col. Campbell prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preston had heard Kate’s voice, and, leaving his
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
lieutenant to pursue the fugitives, sought her out
immediately. His were the eyes she first looked
on when she recovered from her swoon. Her glad
surprise, or his own joy to find her still his own
when he had feared their arrival was too late, we
must leave to the imagination of the reader. It was
one of those scenes human language is too feeble to
portray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, toward daybreak, Marion gave orders for
the town to be evacuated, Kate, so late fainting and
heart-broken, took her place on horse-back between
her father and Preston, almost as rosy-looking and
happy as ever. A spectator could scarcely have
recognized in her the pale and drooping lily of the
evening before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mowbray, on hearing the sacrifice which his
daughter would have made for his life, betrayed the
deepest emotion. He pressed her to his bosom, but
could not speak. There was a gentle reproach in
his eyes, however, which Kate answered by a glance
of unalterable love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Preston learned that old Jacob had
claimed his assistance without the authority of
Kate, he was consoled by her assurance that she
loved him as well as if she had herself despatched
the messenger. In a few weeks she became the
wife of our hero. She would have pleaded for
delay, but her father said he was uncertain how
long his life might be continued, and that he wished
to see her have a protector before he died, so Kate
yielded to his wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Macdonald did not, like his master, live to see
the war concluded. He fell shortly after the attack
on Georgetown, leaving behind him the reputation
of one of the most gallant soldiers of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for old Jacob, he survived to dandle the children
of Kate and Preston on his knee. He had not only
taken part in the fight at Georgetown, but quite distinguished
himself, having slain an English soldier
in single combat. On this feat he was accustomed
to dilate with much self-complacency. He always
wound up the story with these words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He tried now to run me through with his bayonet,
but it was no use, you see. De sarjeant had
larned me his back-handed stroke, and I brought it
around jist so,” suiting the action to the word.
“Wid dat he fell dead and suspendered his breath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somebody once said of our fair hostess, that she
reminded him of a cathedral with a simple, unpretending
portal, which gives you no idea of the rare
revelations within, and through which you pass to
wonders that you did not dream of before. Once
within, you are overwhelmed with the grandeur,
the beauty, the mystery, the majesty around you—the
lofty and magnificent arches, the dim, far-reaching
aisles, the clustered columns, the vaulted roof,
lost to the eye from its wondrous height—the glorious
pictures by the master-hand—the iris-colored
light from the painted windows poured softly over
all—the silence, the religious calm pervading the
place—all combine to awe and elevate the stranger,
who has perhaps rashly and unthinkingly entered
that sanctuary of the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was an enthusiast, a noble one, who said this,
and I cannot tell if it be true. I only know that
she exerts over my individual self a magnetic attraction
and influence, which I do not care to analyze
or to resist, because it soothes and satisfies me
whenever I am with her, however restless and unhappy
I may have been the moment before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasant party were assembled in her drawing-room.

<p class='noindent'>A creature of faultless harmony and grace; but
whose perfect repose of manner, attitude, look and
language, exquisite as it is, almost frightens you
away from her at first. So still, so fair, so pure—like
a snow-cloud moving serenely through the
silent air. There she sits; with her graceful Greek
head bent slightly forward, its luxuriant, light brown
hair wound carelessly and wavily around it; her
chiseled features serenely beautiful, and her hands,
white as Pentelican marble, resting half-clasped
upon her knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I mistake not, beneath that snowy crest, there
are flowers of fancy and fountains of feeling—all the
lovelier and purer for being so guarded, by the vestal,
from the world.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That gleamed about its form,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! that all women could thus proudly wear the
veil! It is a protection we need so much—that
mantle of snow! But there are those (and they
most want it) in whose hearts the waves of feeling
never rest long enough for the winter crust to form—who
never stop to think, to look back, lo reflect,
to prepare; but dash on to the ocean “over bank,
brake and scaur,” giving back only half-formed or
broken images of the beautiful visions that beam
above their way—the bird—the cloud—the flower—the
star—now humming a careless carol to the
breeze, now murmuring a plaintive chant, now
thundering in torrent tones, as they madly leap
adown the rocks that would oppose them, and now
dancing out of sight into the dim, untrodden forest-depths,
where none will dare to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have seen the <a id='stat2'></a>statuesque—there were not
wanting the “grotesque and arabesque,” as well to
our literary <span class='it'>soirée</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one unique, whom I hardly dare
attempt to describe. In speaking he deals principally
in antithesis, and he himself is an antithesis
personified. The wildest conceits—the sharpest
satire—the bitterest, maddest vituperation—the
most exquisite taste—the most subtil appreciation
of the delicate and beautiful in his subject—the
most radiant wit—the most dainty and Ariel-like
fancy—with a manner and a mien the most quaint,
abrupt and uncouth imaginable—it is like nothing
in nature, or rather it is so exceedingly natural that
it seems almost supernatural. His discourse is all
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
thunder and lightning—every play of his impish
eye-brows is an epigram, every smile a jeu d’esprit.
At one time affectionate, confiding, careless, buoyant,
almost boyish in his mood; at another, irritable,
ferocious, seemingly ready for a tiger-spring upon
any foe, and again calm, cold, haughty, and uncomeatable
as an Indian of the olden time. Here is a
stranger original than any his favorite author ever
drew. He is the ideal Yankee of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, too, nestled demurely in a corner of the
sofa was that little “will-o’-the-wisp,” V—, whom
nobody knows what to make of—wild, wayward,
capricious as an April day—changeable as the light
spring-cloud, and restless as the wave—the spoiled
child of Fancy,</p>

<p class='line0'>“Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The love of love!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To those who care for her, all trust and truth, and
poetry and sportive fondness, and deep impassioned
feeling—to all the rest of the world proud, still, reserved,
dull, apathetic, reckless of opinion and of
consequences: a tame Canary-bird to kindness, a
lioness to injustice and oppression. Nature, with
her sympathetic ink, has drawn pictures in her soul,
which seem to the cold and careless only pale,
frost-work, wintry views; but which, in the warmth
of affection, change to glowing summer scenes,
with flowers and foliage, and gleaming springs,
shifting clouds, and singing birds and butterflies, all
of which were always there, and needed only the
summer of sympathy and love to draw them out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By her side sat the man of exhaustless and most
whimsical wit, whom <span class='it'>she</span> calls the “laughing philosopher,”
and whom <span class='it'>I</span> strongly suspect of having
found, and selfishly concealed the “philosopher’s
stone.” He is the most refreshing, contented, and
sunshiny-looking mortal that ever smiled in this
cold world of ours. Ever ready and brilliant, he
whispers his irresistable bon-mots and his charming
jeux d’esprit, as if he were ashamed of them, and
calls it a breach of confidence if they are repeated
aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to him sat the stately, intellectual, and warm-hearted
Mrs. ——, who, according to her witty
neighbour, always looks “up to an epic.” I suppose
he will call <span class='it'>this</span> a betrayal of confidence; but when
these pages meet his eyes, I shall fortunately be far
beyond the reach of his cutlass-irony; so spare yourself,
till I come back, “most potent, grave, and reverend
seignor,” and don’t “waste your <span class='it'>satire</span> on the
desert air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In earnest conversation with the lovely and loveable
Mrs. S——, was young ——. His rare and
pure intellect; his “Doric delicacy” of taste; his
gentle and winning manners; his sensitive, generous,
and trustful nature, are best appreciated by
those who know him best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well—first we played the game of “What is my
thought like.” Smile not, sagacious reader—Canning
did the same. Several good answers were
elicited in the course of the game, among which
were the following:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is a dew-drop like Miss R’s sash?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it trembles on a flower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is fame like a clasp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is all a catch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is Mrs. —— like an omnibus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because we are all carried away by her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is my heart like a mirror?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you can see <span class='it'>yourself</span> in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the game was over, one of the gentlemen
took from his pocket a volume of poems, by that
Proteus author, “Anon,” of which he happened to
have the only copy in the country, and read aloud
the following verses, in a voice tremulous with the
weight of its own melody and feeling:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near night-fall when the Swash anchored
among the low and small islets mentioned. Rose
had been on deck, as the vessel approached this
singular and solitary haven, watching the movements
of those on board, as well as the appearance
of objects on the land, with the interest her situation
would be likely to awaken. She saw the light and
manageable craft glide through the narrow and
crooked passages that led into the port, the process
of anchoring, and the scene of tranquil solitude that
succeeded; each following the other as by a law
of nature. The light-house next attracted her attention,
and, as soon as the sun disappeared, her eyes
were fastened on the lantern, in expectation of beholding
the watchful and warning fires gleaming
there, to give the mariner notice of the position of
the dangers that surrounded the place. Minute
went by after minute, however, and the customary
illumination seemed to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is not the light shining?” Rose asked of
Mulford, as the young man came near her, after
having discharged his duty in helping to moor the
vessel, and in clearing the decks. “All the light-houses
we have passed, and they have been fifty,
have shown bright lights at this hour, but this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot explain it; nor have I the smallest notion
where we are. I have been aloft, and there
was nothing in sight but this cluster of low islets,
far or near. I did fancy, for a moment, I saw a
speck like a distant sail, off here to the northward
and eastward, but I rather think it was a gull, or
some other sea-bird glancing upward on the wing.
I mentioned it to the captain when I came down,
and he appeared to believe it a mistake. I have
watched that light-house closely, too, ever since we
came in, and I have not seen the smallest sign of
life about it. It is altogether an extraordinary
place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One suited to acts of villany, I fear, Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of that we shall be better judges to-morrow.
You, at least, have one vigilant friend, who will die
sooner than harm shall come to you. I believe
Spike to be thoroughly unprincipled; still he knows
he can go so far and no further, and has a wholesome
dread of the law. But the circumstance that
there should be such a port as this, with a regular
light-house, and no person near the last, is so much
out of the common way, that I do not know what to
make of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps the light-house keeper is afraid to show
himself, in the presence of the Swash?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That can hardly be, for vessels must often enter
the port, if port it can be called. But Spike is as
much concerned at the circumstance that the lamps
are not lighted, as any of us can be. Look, he
is about to visit the building in the boat, accompanied
by two of his oldest sea-dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why might we not raise the anchor, and sail
out of this place, leaving Spike ashore?” suggested
Rose, with more decision and spirit than discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the simple reason that the act would be
piracy, even if I could get the rest of the people to
obey my orders, as certainly I could not. No, Rose,
you, and your aunt, and Biddy, however, might land
at these buildings, and refuse to return, Spike having
no authority over his passengers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still he would have the <span class='it'>power</span> to make us come
back to his brig. Look, he has left the vessel’s side,
and is going directly toward the light-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford made no immediate answer, but remained
at Rose’s side, watching the movements of
the captain. The last pulled directly to the islet
with the buildings, a distance of only a few hundred
feet, the light-house being constructed on a rocky
island that was nearly in the centre of the cluster,
most probably with a view to protect it from the
ravages of the waves. The fact, however, proved,
as Mulford did not fail to suggest to his companion,
that the beacon had been erected less to guide vessels
<span class='it'>into</span> the haven, than to warn mariners at a distance,
of the position of the whole group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than five minutes after he had landed,
Spike himself was seen in the lantern, in the act of
lighting its lamps. In a very short time the place was
in a brilliant blaze, reflectors and all the other parts
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
of the machinery of the place performing their duties
as regularly as if tended by the usual keeper. Soon
after Spike returned on board, and the anchor-watch
was set. Then everybody sought the rest that it
was customary to take at that hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford was on deck with the appearance of the
sun; but he found that Spike had preceded him, had
gone ashore again, had extinguished the lamps, and
was coming alongside of the brig on his return. A
minute later the captain came over the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right about your sail, last night,
a’ter all, Mr. Mulford,” said Spike, on coming aft.
“There she is, sure enough; and we shall have her
alongside to strike cargo out and in, by the time the
people have got their breakfasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Spike pointed toward the light-house while
speaking, the mate changed his position a little, and
saw that a schooner was coming down toward the
islets before the wind. Mulford now began to understand
the motives of the captain’s proceedings,
though a good deal yet remained veiled in mystery.
He could not tell where the brig was, nor did he
know precisely why so many expedients were
adopted to conceal the transfer of a cargo as simple
as that of flour. But he who was in the secret left
but little time for reflection; for swallowing a hasty
breakfast on deck, he issued orders enough to his
mate to give him quite as much duty as he could
perform, when he again entered the yawl, and pulled
toward the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose soon appeared on deck, and she naturally
began to question Harry concerning their position
and prospects. He was confessing his ignorance
as well as lamenting it, when his companion’s sweet
face suddenly flushed. She advanced a step eagerly
toward the open window of Spike’s state-room, then
compressed her full, rich, under-lip with the ivory
of her upper teeth, and stood a single instant, a
beautiful statue of irresolution instigated by spirit.
The last quality prevailed; and Mulford was really
startled when he saw Rose advance quite to the
window, thrust in an arm, and turn toward him with
his own sextant in her hand. During the course of
the passage out, the young man had taught Rose to
assist him in observing the longitude; and she was
now ready to repeat the practice. Not a moment
was lost in executing her intention. Sights were
had, and the instrument was returned to its place
without attracting the attention of the men, who
were all busy in getting up purchases, and in making
the other necessary dispositions for discharging the
flour. The observations answered the purpose,
though somewhat imperfectly made. Mulford had
a tolerable notion of their latitude, having kept the
brig’s run in his head since quitting Yucatan; and
he now found that their longitude was about 83°
west from Greenwich. After ascertaining this fact,
a glance at the open chart, which lay on Spike’s
desk, satisfied him that the vessel was anchored
within the group of the Dry Tortugas, or at the
western termination of the well-known, formidable,
and extensive Florida Reef. He had never been in
that part of the world before, but had heard enough
in sea-gossip, and had read enough in books, to be
at once apprised of the true character of their situation.
The islets were American; the light-house
was American; and the haven in which the Swash
lay was the very spot in the contemplation of government
for an outer man-of-war harbor, where fleets
might rendezvous in the future wars of that portion
of the world. He now saw plainly enough the signs
of the existence of a vast reef, a short distance to the
southward of the vessel, that formed a species of
sea-wall, or mole, to protect the port against the
waves of the gulf, in that direction. This reef he
knew to be miles in width.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little time for speculation, Spike soon
bringing the strange schooner directly alongside of
the brig. The two vessels immediately became a
scene of activity, one discharging, and the other receiving
the flour as fast as it could be struck out of
the hold of the Swash and lowered upon the deck of
the schooner. Mulford, however, had practiced a
little artifice, as the stranger entered the haven,
which drew down upon him an anathema or two
from Spike, as soon as they were alone. The mate
had set the brig’s ensign, and this compelled the
stranger to be markedly rude, or to answer the compliment.
Accordingly he had shown the ancient
flag of Spain. For thus extorting a national symbol
from the schooner, the mate was sharply rebuked
at a suitable moment, though nothing could have
been more forbearing than the deportment of his
commander when they first met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Spike returned to his own vessel, he was
accompanied by a dark-looking, well-dressed, and
decidedly gentleman-like personage, whom he addressed
indifferently, in his very imperfect Spanish,
as Don Wan, (Don Juan, or John,) or Señor Montefalderon.
By the latter appellation he even saw
fit to introduce the very respectable-looking stranger
to his mate. This stranger spoke English well,
though with an accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Wan has taken all the flour, Mr. Mulford,
and intends shoving it over into Cuba, without
troubling the custom-house, I believe; but that is
not a matter to give <span class='it'>us</span> any concern, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wink, and the knowing look by which this
speech was accompanied, seemed particularly disagreeable
to Don Juan, who now paid his compliments
to Rose, with no little surprise betrayed in
his countenance, but with the ease and reserve of a
gentleman. Mulford thought it strange that a smuggler
of flour should be so polished a personage,
though his duty did not admit of his bestowing much
attention to the little trifling of the interview that
succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For about an hour the work went steadily and
rapidly on. During that time Mulford was several
times on board the schooner, as, indeed, was Josh,
Jack Tier, and others belonging to the Swash. The
Spanish vessel was Baltimore, or clipper built, with
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
a trunk-cabin, and had every appearance of sailing
fast. Mulford was struck with her model, and,
while on board of her, he passed both forward and
aft to examine it. This was so natural in a seaman,
that Spike, while he noted the proceeding, took it in
good part. He even called out to his mate, from
his own quarter-deck, to admire this or that point in
the schooner’s construction. As is customary with
the vessels of southern nations, this stranger was
full of men, but they continued at their work, some
half dozen of brawny negroes among them, shouting
their songs as they swayed at the falls, no one
appearing to manifest jealousy or concern. At
length Tier came near the mate, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Sam will not be pleased when he hears
the reason that the keeper is not in his light-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is that reason, Jack? If you know it,
tell it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go aft and look down the companion way, maty,
and see it for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford did go aft, and he made an occasion to
look down into the schooner’s cabin, where he
caught a glimpse of the persons of a man and a boy,
whom he at once supposed had been taken from the
light-house. This one fact of itself doubled his distrust
of the character of Spike’s proceedings. There
was no sufficient apparent reason why a mere
smuggler should care about the presence of an individual
more or less in a foreign port. Every thing
that had occurred looked like pre-concert between
the brig and the schooner; and the mate was just
beginning to entertain the strongest distrust that
their vessel was holding treasonable communication
with the enemy, when an accident removed all
doubt on the subject, from his own mind at least.
Spike had, once or twice, given his opinion that the
weather was treacherous, and urged the people of
both crafts to extraordinary exertions, in order that
the vessels might get clear of each other as soon as
possible. This appeal had set various expedients
in motion to second the more regular work of the
purchases. Among other things, planks had been
laid from one vessel to the other, and barrels were
rolled along them with very little attention to the
speed or the direction. Several had fallen on the
schooner’s deck with rude shocks, but no damage
was done, until one, of which the hoops had not been
properly secured, met with a fall, and burst nearly
at Mulford’s feet. It was at the precise moment
when the mate was returning, from taking his glance
into the cabin, toward the side of the Swash. A
white cloud arose, and half a dozen of the schooner’s
people sprang for buckets, kids, or dishes in order
to secure enough of the contents of the broken
barrel to furnish them with a meal. At first nothing
was visible but the white cloud that succeeded the
fall, and the scrambling sailors in its midst. No
sooner, however, had the air got to be a little clear,
than Mulford saw an object lying in the centre of the
wreck, that he at once recognized for a keg of gunpowder!
The captain of the schooner seized this
keg, gave a knowing look at Mulford, and disappeared
in the hold of his own vessel, carrying with
him, what was out of all question, a most material
part of the true cargo of the Swash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment when the flour-barrel burst, Spike
was below, in close conference with his Spanish, or
Mexican guest; and the wreck being so soon cleared
away, it is probable that he never heard of the accident.
As for the two crews, they laughed a little
among themselves at the revelation which had been
made, as well as at the manner; but to old sea-dogs
like them, it was a matter of very little moment,
whether the cargo was, in reality, flour or gunpowder.
In a few minutes the affair seemed to be
<a id='forg'></a>forgotten. In the course of another hour the Swash
was light, having nothing in her but some pig lead,
which she used for ballast, while the schooner was
loaded to her hatches, and full. Spike now sent a
boat, with orders to drop a kedge about a hundred
yards from the place where his own brig lay. The
schooner warped up to this kedge, and dropped an
anchor of her own, leaving a very short range of
cable out, it being a flat calm. Ordinarily, the trades
prevail at the Dry Tortugas, and all along the Florida
Reef. Sometimes, indeed, this breeze sweeps across
the whole width of the Gulf of Mexico, blowing
home, as it is called—reaching even to the coast of
Texas. It is subject, however, to occasional interruptions
everywhere, varying many points in its
direction, and occasionally ceasing entirely. The
latter was the condition of the weather about noon
on this day, or when the schooner hauled off from
the brig, and was secured at her own anchor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Mulford,” said Spike, “I do not like the state
of the atmosphere. D’ye see that fiery streak along
the western horizon—well, sir, as the sun gets nearer
to that streak, there’ll be trouble, or I’m no judge of
weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely do not imagine, Capt. Spike, that the
sun will be any nearer to that fiery streak, as you
call it, when he is about to set, than he is at this moment?”
answered the mate, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure of one thing, young man, and that is,
that old heads are better than young ones. What a
man has once seen, he may expect to see again, if
the same leading signs offer. Man the boat, sir, and
carry out the kedge, which is still in it, and lay it off
here, about three p’ints on our larboard bow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford had a profound respect for Spike’s seamanship,
whatever he might <a id='thin'></a>think of his principles.
The order was consequently obeyed. The mate
was then directed to send down various articles out
of the top, and to get the top-gallant and royal yards
on deck. Spike carried his precautions so far, as to
have the mainsail lowered, it ordinarily brailing at
that season of the year, with a standing gaff. With
this disposition completed, the captain seemed more
at his ease, and went below to join Señor Montefalderon
in a <span class='it'>siesta</span>. The Mexican, for such, in truth, was
the national character of the owner of the schooner,
had preceded him in this indulgence: and most of
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
the people of the brig having laid themselves down
to sleep under the heat of the hour, Mulford soon
enjoyed another favorable opportunity for a private
conference with Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry,” commenced the latter, as soon as they
were alone; “I have much to tell you. While you
have been absent I have overheard a conversation
between this Spanish gentleman and Spike, that
shows the last is in treaty with the other for the sale
of the brig. Spike extolled his vessel to the skies,
while Don Wan, as he calls him, complains that the
brig is old, and cannot last long; to which Spike
answered ‘to be sure she is old, Señor Montefalderon,
but she will last as long as <span class='it'>your war</span>, and
under a bold captain might be made to return her
cost, a hundred fold!’ What war can he mean, and
to what does such a discourse tend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war alludes to the war now existing between
America and Mexico, and the money to be
made is to be plundered at sea, from our own merchant
vessels. If Don Juan Montefalderon is really
in treaty for the purchase of the brig, it is to convert
her into a Mexican cruiser, either public or private.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this would be treason on the part of Spike!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not more so than supplying the enemy with
gunpowder, as he has just been doing. I have ascertained
the reason he was so unwilling to be
overhauled by the revenue steamer, as well as the
reason why the revenue steamer wished so earnestly
to overhaul us. Each barrel of flour contains
another of gunpowder, and that has been sold to this
Señor Montefalderon, who is doubtless an officer of
the Mexican government, and no smuggler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has been at New York, this very summer, I
know,” continued Rose, “for he spoke of his visit,
and made such other remarks, as leaves no doubt
that Spike expected to find him here, on this very
day of the month. He also paid Spike a large sum
of money in doubloons, and took back the bag to his
schooner, when he had done so, after showing the
captain enough was left to pay for the brig, could
they only agree on the terms of their bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay; it is all plain enough now, Spike has
determined on a desperate push for fortune, and
foreseeing it might not soon be in his power to return
to New York, in safety, he has included his designs
on you and your fortune, in the plot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My fortune! the trifle I possess can scarcely be
called a fortune, Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a fortune to Spike, Rose, and I shall
be honest enough to own it would be a fortune to
me. I say this frankly, for I do believe you think too
well of me to suppose that I seek you for any other
reason than the ardent love I bear your person and
character; but a fact is not to be denied because it
may lead certain persons to distrust our motives.
Spike is poor, like myself; and the brig is not only
getting to be very old, but she has been losing
money for the last twelve months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford and Rose now conversed long and confidentially,
on their situation and prospects. The
mate neither magnified nor concealed the dangers
of both; but freely pointed out the risk to himself, in
being on board a vessel that was aiding and comforting
the enemy. It was determined between
them that both would quit the brig the moment an
opportunity offered, and the mate even went so far
as to propose an attempt to escape in one of the
boats, although he might incur the hazards of a double
accusation, those of mutiny and larceny, for
making the experiment. Unfortunately, neither
Rose, nor her aunt, nor Biddy, nor Jack Tier had
seen the barrel of powder, and neither could testify
as to the true character of Spike’s connection with
the schooner. It was manifestly necessary, therefore,
independently of the risks that might be run by
“bearding the lion in his den,” to proceed with great
intelligence and caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This dialogue between Harry and Rose, occurred
just after the turn in the day, and it lasted fully an
hour. Each had been too much interested to observe
the heavens, but, as they were on the point of
separating, Rose pointed out to her companion the
unusual and most menacing aspect of the sky in the
western horizon. It appeared as if a fiery heat was
glowing there, behind a curtain of black vapor; and
what rendered it more remarkable, was the circumstance
that an extraordinary degree of placidity prevailed
in all other parts of the heavens. Mulford
scarce knew what to make of it; his experience not
going so far as to enable him to explain the novel
and alarming appearance. He stepped on a gun,
and gazed around him for a moment. There lay
the schooner, without a being visible on board of her,
and there stood the light-house, gloomy in its desertion
and solitude. The birds alone seemed to be
alive and conscious of what was approaching. They
were all on the wing, wheeling wildly in the air,
and screaming discordantly, as belonged to their
habits. The young man leaped off the gun, gave
a loud call to Spike, at the companion-way, and
sprang forward to call all hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One minute only was lost, when every seaman
on board the Swash, from the captain to Jack Tier,
was on deck. Mulford met Spike at the cabin door,
and pointed toward the fiery column that was booming
down upon the anchorage, with a velocity and
direction that would now admit of no misinterpretation.
For one instant that sturdy old seaman stood
aghast; gazing at the enemy as one conscious of his
impotency might have been supposed to quail before
an assault that he foresaw must prove irresistable.
Then his native spirit, and most of all the effects of
training, began to show themselves in him, and he
became at once, not only the man again, but the resolute,
practiced and ready commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come aft to the spring, men—” he shouted—“clap
on the spring, Mr. Mulford, and bring the brig
head to wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This order was obeyed as seamen best obey, in
cases of sudden and extreme emergency; or with
intelligence, aptitude and power. The brig had
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
swung nearly round, in the desired direction, when
the tornado struck her. It will be difficult, we do
not know but it is impossible, to give a clear and accurate
account of what followed. As most of our
readers have doubtless felt how great is the power
of the wind, whiffling and pressing different ways,
in sudden and passing gusts, they have only to imagine
this power increased many, many fold, and the
baffling of the currents made furious, as it might be,
by meeting with resistance, to form some notion of
the appalling strength and frightful inconstancy with
which it blew for about a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the circumstance of Spike’s precaution
had greatly lessened the danger, every man
on the deck of the Swash believed the brig was gone
when the gust struck her. Over she went, in fact,
until the water came pouring in above her half-ports,
like so many little cascades, and spouting up through
her scupper-holes, resembling the blowing of young
whales. It was the whiffling energy of the tornado,
that alone saved her. As if disappointed in not destroying
its intended victim at one swoop, the tornado
“let up” in its pressure, like a dexterous wrestler,
making a fresh and desperate effort to overturn
the vessel, by a slight variation in its course. That
change saved the Swash. She righted, and even
rolled in the other direction, or what might be called
to windward, with her decks full of water. For a
minute longer, these baffling, changing gusts continued,
each causing the brig to bow like a reed to
their power, one lifting as another pressed her down,
and then the weight, or the more dangerous part of
the tornado was passed, though it continued to blow
heavily, always in whiffling blasts, several minutes
longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the weight of the gust, no one had leisure,
or indeed inclination to look to aught beyond its effect
on the brig. Had one been otherwise disposed,
the attempt would have been useless, for the wind
had filled the air with spray, and near the islets even
with sand. The lurid but fiery tinge, too, interposed
a veil that no human eye could penetrate. As the
tornado passed onward, however, and the winds
lulled, the air again became clear, and in five
minutes after the moment when the Swash lay
nearly on her side, with her lower yard-arm actually
within a few feet of the water, all was still and placid
around her, as one is accustomed to see the
ocean in a calm, of a summer’s afternoon. Then
it was that those who had been in such extreme
jeopardy could breathe freely and look about them.
On board the Swash, all was well—not a rope-yarn
had parted, or an eye-bolt drawn. The timely precautions
of Spike had saved his brig, and great was
his joy thereat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of the infernal din of the tornado,
screams had ascended from the cabin, and the instant
he could quit the deck with propriety, Mulford
sprang below, in order to ascertain their cause. He
apprehended that some of the females had been
driven to leeward when the brig went over, and
that some of the luggage or furniture had fallen on
them. In the main cabin, the mate found Señor
Montefalderon just quitting his berth, composed,
gentleman-like, and collected. Josh was braced in
a corner nearly gray with fear, while Jack Tier still
lay on the cabin floor, at the last point to which he
had rolled. One word sufficed to let Don Juan
know that the gust had passed, and the brig was
safe, when Mulford tapped at the door of the inner
cabin. Rose appeared, pale, but calm and unhurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is <a id='any'></a>any one injured?” asked the young man,
his mind relieved at once, as soon as he saw that
she who most occupied his thoughts was safe; “we
heard screams from this cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt and Biddy have been frightened,” answered
Rose, “but neither has been hurt. Oh,
Harry, what terrible thing has happened to us? I
heard the roaring of—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Twas a tornado,” interrupted Mulford eagerly—“but
’tis over. ’Twas one of those sudden and
tremendous gusts that sometimes occur within the
tropics, in which the danger is usually in the first
shock. If no one is injured in this cabin, no one is
injured at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Mulford—dear Mr. Mulford!” exclaimed
the relict from the corner into which she had been
followed and jammed by Biddy, “Oh, Mr. Mulford,
are we foundered, or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven be praised, not, my dear ma’am, though
we came nearer to it than I ever was before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we cap-asided?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor that, Mrs. Budd; the brig is as upright as a
church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upright!” repeated Biddy, in her customary
accent—“is it as a church? Sure, then, Mr. Mate,
’tis a Presbyterian church that you mane, and that
is always totterin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catholic, or Dutch—no church in York is more
completely up and down, than the brig at this
moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get off of me—get off of me, Biddy, and let me
rise,” said the widow, with dignity. “The danger
is over I see, and, as we return our thanks for it, we
have the consolation of knowing that we have done
our duty. It is incumbent on all, at such moments,
to be at their posts, and to set examples of decision
and prudence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mulford saw all was well in the cabin, he
hastened on deck, followed by Señor Montefalderon.
Just as they emerged from the companion-way,
Spike was hailing the forecastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forecastle, there,” he cried, standing on the
trunk himself as he did so, and moving from side
to side, as if to catch a glimpse of some object
ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” came back from an old salt, who was
coiling up rigging in that seat of seamanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where away is the schooner? She ought to be
dead ahead of us, as we tend now—but blast me if
I can see as much as her mast-heads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this suggestion, a dozen men sprang upon guns
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
or other objects, to look for the vessel in question.
The old salt forward, however, had much the best
chance, for he stepped on the heel of the bowsprit,
and walked as far out as the knight-heads, to command
the whole view ahead of the brig. There he
stood half a minute, looking first on one side of
the head-gear, then the other, when he gave his
trousers a hitch, put a fresh quid in his mouth,
and called out in a voice almost as hoarse as the
tempest, that had just gone by,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The schooner has gone down at her anchor,
sir. There’s her buoy watching still, as if nothing
had happened; but as for the craft itself, there’s not
so much as a bloody yard-arm, or mast-head of her
to be seen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This news produced a sensation in the brig at
once, as may be supposed. Even Señor Montefalderon,
a quiet, gentleman-like person, altogether
superior in deportment to the bustle and fuss that
usually marks the manners of persons in trade, was
disturbed; for to him the blow was heavy indeed.
Whether he were acting for himself, or was an
agent of the Mexican government, the loss was
much the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom is right enough,” put in Spike, rather coolly
for the circumstances—“that there schooner of
yourn has foundered, Don Wan, as any one can see.
She must have capsized and filled, for I obsarved
they had left the hatches off, meaning, no doubt, to
make an end of the storage as soon as they had
done sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what has become of all her men, Don
Esteban?” for so the Mexican politely called his
companion. “Have all my poor countrymen
perished in this disaster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear they have, Don Wan; for I see no head,
as of any one swimming. The vessel lay so near
that island next to it, that a poor swimmer would
have no difficulty in reaching the place; but there
is no living thing to be seen. But man the boat,
men; we will go to the spot, Señor, and examine
for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two boats in the water, and alongside
of the brig. One was the Swash’s yawl, a
small but convenient craft, while the other was
much larger, fitted with a sail, and had all the appearance
of having been built to withstand breezes and
seas. Mulford felt perfectly satisfied, the moment
he saw this boat, which had come into the haven
in tow of the schooner, that it had been originally
in the service of the light-house keeper. As there
was a very general desire among those on the
quarterdeck to go to the assistance of the schooner,
Spike ordered both boats manned, jumping into the
yawl himself, accompanied by Don Juan Montefalderon,
and telling Mulford to follow with the
larger craft, bringing with him as many of the females
as might choose to accompany him. As Mrs. Budd
thought it incumbent on her to be active in such a
scene, all did go, including Biddy, though with great
reluctance on the part of Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the buoy for a guide, Spike had no difficulty
in finding the spot where the schooner lay.
She had scarcely shifted her berth in the least, there
having been no time for her even to swing to the
gust, but she had probably capsized at the first blast,
filled, and gone down instantly. The water was
nearly as clear as the calm, mild atmosphere of the
tropics; and it was almost as easy to discern the
vessel, and all her hamper, as if she lay on a beach.
She had gone down as she filled, or on her side, and
still continued in that position. As the water was
little more than three fathoms deep, the upper side
was submerged but a few inches, and her yard-arms
would have been out of the water, but for the
circumstance that the yards had canted under the
pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, no sign was seen of any of those who had
been on board this ill-fated schooner when she went
down. It was known that twenty-one souls were in
her, including the man and the boy who had belonged
to the light-house. As the boat moved slowly over
this sad ruin, however, a horrible and startling
spectacle came in view. Two bodies were seen,
within a few feet of the surface of the water, one
grasped in the arms of the other, in the gripe of
despair. The man held in the grasp, was kept beneath
the water solely by the death-lock of his companion,
who was himself held where he floated, by
the circumstance that one of his feet was entangled
in a rope. The struggle could not have been long
over, for the two bodies were slowly settling toward
the bottom when first seen. It is probable that both
these men had more than once risen to the surface
in their dreadful struggle. Spike seized a boat-hook,
and made an effort to catch the clothes of the nearest
body, but ineffectually, both sinking to the sands beneath,
lifeless, and without motion. There being
no sharks in sight, Mulford volunteered to dive and
fasten a line to one of these unfortunate men, whom
Don Juan declared at once was the schooner’s captain.
Some little time was lost in procuring a lead-line
from the brig, when the lead was dropped alongside
of the drowned. Provided with another piece
of the same sort of line, which had a small running
bowline around that which was fastened to the lead,
the mate made his plunge, and went down with
great vigor of arm. It required resolution and
steadiness to descend so far into salt water; but
Harry succeeded, and rose with the bodies, which
came up with the slightest impulse. All were immediately
got into the boat, and away the latter
went toward the light-house, which was nearer and
more easy of access than the brig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is probable that one of these unfortunate men
might have been revived under judicious treatment;
but he was not fated to receive it. Spike, who
knew nothing of such matters, undertook to direct
every thing, and, instead of having recourse to
warmth and gentle treatment, he ordered the bodies
to be rolled on a cask, suspended them by the heels,
and resorted to a sort of practice that might have
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
destroyed well men, instead of resuscitating those
in whom the vital spark was dormant, if not actually
extinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours later, Rose, seated in her own cabin,
unavoidably overheard the following dialogue, which
passed in English, a language that Señor Montefalderon
spoke perfectly well, as has been said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well Señor,” said Spike, “I hope this little accident
will not prevent our final trade. You will
want the brig now, to take the schooner’s place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how am I to pay you for the brig, Señor
Spike, even if I buy her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ventur’ to guess there is plenty of money in
Mexico. Though they do say the government is
so backward about paying, I have always found you
punctual, and am not afraid to put faith in you
ag’in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no longer any money to pay you half
in hand, as I did for the powder, when last in New
York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bag was pretty well lined with doubloons
when I saw it last, Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you know where that bag is; and where
there is another that holds the same sum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike started, and he mused in silence some little
time, ere he again spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten,” he at length answered. “The
gold must have all gone down in the schooner, along
with the powder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the poor men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, as for the men, Señor, more may be had
for the asking; but powder and doubloons will be
hard to find, when most wanted. Then the men
were <span class='it'>poor</span> men, accordin’ to my idees of what an
able seaman should be, or they never would have
let their schooner turn turtle with them as she
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will talk of the money, Don Esteban, if you
please,” said the Mexican, with reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my heart, Don Wan—nothing is more
agreeable to me than money. How many of them
doubloons shall fall to my share if I raise the
schooner, and put you in possession of your craft
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can that be done, Señor?” demanded Don Juan
earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A seaman can do almost any thing, in that way,
Don Wan, if you will give him time and means.
For one half the doubloons I can find in the wrack,
the job shall be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can have them,” answered Don Juan,
quietly, a good deal surprised that Spike should
deem it necessary to offer him any part of the sum
he might find. “As for the powder, I suppose that
is lost to my country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Don Wan. The flour is well packed
around it, and I don’t expect it would take any
harm in a month. I shall not only turn over the
flour to you, just as if nothing had happened, but I
shall put four first rate hands aboard your schooner,
who will take her into port for you, with a good
deal more sartainty than forty of the men you had.
My mate is a prime navigator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This concluded the bargain, every word of which
was heard by Rose, and every word of which she
did not fail to communicate to Mulford, the moment
there was an opportunity. The young man heard
it with great interest, telling Rose that he should do
all he could to assist in raising the schooner, in the
hope that something might turn up to enable him to
escape in her, taking off Rose and her aunt. As
for his carrying her into a Mexican port, let them
trust him for that! Agreeably to the arrangement,
orders were given that afternoon to commence the
necessary preparations for the work, and considerable
progress was made in them by the time the
Swash’s people were ordered to knock off work for
the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the sun had set the reaction in the currents
again commenced, and it blew for a few hours
heavily, during the night. Toward morning, however,
it moderated, and when the sun re-appeared
it scarcely ever diffused its rays over a more peaceful
or quiet day. Spike caused all hands to be
called, and immediately set about the important
business he had before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order that the vessel might be as free as possible,
Jack Tier was directed to skull the females
ashore, in the brig’s yawl; Señor Montefalderon, a
man of polished manners, as we maintain is very
apt to be the case with Mexican gentlemen, whatever
may be the opinion of this good republic on the
subject, just at this moment, asked permission to be
of the party. Mulford found an opportunity to beg
Rose, if they landed at the light, to reconnoitre the
place well, with a view to ascertain what facilities
it could afford in an attempt to escape. They did
land at the light, and glad enough were Mrs. Budd,
Rose and Biddy to place their feet on <span class='it'>terrâ firmâ</span>
after so long a confinement to the narrow limits of a
vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Jack Tier, as they walked up to the
spot where the buildings stood, “this is a rum place
for a light’us, Miss Rose, and I don’t wonder the
keeper and his messmates has cleared out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry to say,” observed Señor Montefalderon,
whose countenance expressed the concern
he really felt, “that the keeper and his only
companion, a boy, were on board the schooner, and
have perished in her, in common with so many of my
poor countrymen. There are the graves of two
whom we buried here last evening, after vain efforts
to restore them to life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a dreadful catastrophe it has been, Señor,”
said Rose, whose sweet countenance eloquently expressed
the horror and regret she so naturally felt—“Twenty
fellow beings hurried into eternity without
even an instant for prayer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feel for them, Señorita—it is natural <span class='it'>you</span>
should, and it is natural that I, their countryman and
leader, should feel for them, also. I do not know
what God has in reserve for my unfortunate country!
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
We may have cruel and unscrupulous men
among us, Señorita, but we have thousands who are
just, and brave, and honorable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Mr. Mulford tells me, Señor, and he has been
much in your ports, on the west coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that young man, and wonder not a little at
his and your situation in this brig—” rejoined the
Mexican, dropping his voice so as not to be heard
by their companions, as they walked a little ahead of
Mrs. Budd and Biddy. “The Señor Spike is scarcely
worthy to be <span class='it'>his</span> commander or <span class='it'>your</span> guardian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you find him worthy of your intercourse and
trust, Don Juan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mexican shrugged his shoulders, and smiled
equivocally; still, in a melancholy manner. It would
seem he did not deem it wise to push this branch of
the subject further, since he turned to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the Señor Mulford,” he resumed, “for his
general deportment and principles, so far as I can
judge of him on so short an acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, Señor,” interrupted Rose, hurriedly “—but
you never saw <span class='it'>him</span> until you met him here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never—I understand you, Señorita, and can do
full justice to the young man’s character. I am willing
to think he did not know the errand of his vessel,
or I should not have seen him now. But what
I most like him for, is this: Last night, during the
gale, he and I walked the deck together, for an hour.
We talked of Mexico, and of this war, so unfortunate
for my country already, and which may become
still more so, when he uttered this noble sentiment—‘My
country is more powerful than yours, Señor
Montefalderon,’ he said, ‘and in this it has been more
favored by God. You have suffered from ambitious
rulers, and from military rule, while we have been
advancing under the arts of peace, favored by a most
beneficent Providence. As for this war, I know but
little about it, though I dare say the Mexican government
may have been wrong in some things that it
might have controlled and some that it might not—but
let right be where it will, I am sorry to see a
nation that has taken so firm a stand in favor of
popular government, pressed upon so hard by another
that is supposed to be the great support of
such principles. America and Mexico are neighbors,
and ought to be friends, and while I do not,
cannot blame my own country for pursuing the war
with vigor, nothing would please me more than to
hear peace proclaimed.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just like Harry Mulford,” said Rose,
thoughtfully, as soon as her companion ceased to
speak. “I do wish, Señor, that there could be no
use for this powder, that is now buried in the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan Montefalderon smiled, and seemed a
little surprised that the fair, young thing at his side
should have known of the treacherous contents of
the flour-barrels. No doubt he found it inexplicable,
that persons like Rose and Mulford should, seemingly,
be united with one like Spike; but he was
too well bred, and, indeed, too effectually mystified,
to push the subject further than might be discreet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time they were near the entrance of the
light-house, into which the whole party entered, in
a sort of mute awe at its silence and solitude. At
Señor Montefalderon’s invitation, they ascended to
the lantern, whence they could command a wide
and fair view of the surrounding waters. The reef
was much more apparent from that elevation than
from below; and Rose could see that numbers of its
rocks were bare, while on other parts of it there
was the appearance of many feet of water. Rose
gazed at it, with longing eyes, for, from a few remarks
that had fallen from Mulford, she suspected
he had hopes of escaping among its channels and
coral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they descended and walked through the buildings,
Rose also took good heed of the supplies the
place afforded. There were flour, and beef, and
pork; and many other of the common articles of
food, as well as water in a cistern, that caught it as
it flowed from the roof of the dwelling. Water was
also to be found in casks—nothing like a spring or
a well existing among those islets. All these things
Rose noted, putting them aside in her memory for
ready reference hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the mariners were not idle.
Spike moved his brig, and moored her, head and
stern, alongside of the wreck, before the people got
their breakfasts. As soon as that meal was ended,
both captain and mate set about their duty in
earnest. Mulford carried out an anchor on the off
side of the Swash, and dropped it, at a distance of
about eighty fathoms from the vessel’s beam. Purchases
were brought from both mast-heads of the
brig to the chain of this anchor, and were hove upon
until the vessel was given a heel of more than a
streak, and the cable was tolerably taut. Other purchases
were got up opposite, and overhauled down,
in readiness to take hold of the schooner’s masts.
The anchor of the schooner was weighed by its
buoy-rope, and the chain, after being rove through
the upper or opposite hawse-hole, brought in on
board the Swash. Another chain was dropped
astern, in such a way, that when the schooner came
upright, it would be sure to pass beneath her keel,
some six or eight feet from the rudder. Slings were
then sunk over the mast-heads, and the purchases
were hooked on. Hours were consumed in these
preliminary labors, and the people went to dinner
as soon as they were completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the men had dined, Spike brought one of
his purchases to the windlass, and the other to the
capstan, though not until each was bowsed taut by
hand; a few minutes having brought the strain so
far on every thing, as to enable a seaman, like Spike,
to form some judgment of the likelihood that his
preventers and purchases would stand. Some
changes were found necessary to equalize the strain,
but, on the whole, the captain was satisfied with his
work, and the crew were soon ordered to “heave-away;
the windlass best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of half an hour the hull of the vessel,
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
which lay on its bilge, began to turn on its keel,
and the heads of the spars to rise above the water.
This was the easiest part of the process, all that was
required of the purchases being to turn over a mass
which rested on the sands of the bay. Aided by
the long levers afforded by the spars, the work advanced
so rapidly that, in just one hour’s time after
his people had begun to heave, Spike had the pleasure
to see the schooner standing upright, alongside
of his own brig, though still sunk to the bottom.
The wreck was secured in this position, by means
of guys and preventers, in order that it might not
again cant, when the order was issued to hook on
the slings that were to raise it to the surface. These
slings were the chains of the schooner, one of which
went under her keel, while for the other the captain
trusted to the strength of the two hawse-holes, having
passed the cable out of one and in at the other,
in a way to serve his purposes, as has just been
stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all was ready, Spike mustered his crew,
and made a speech. He told the men that he was
about a job that was out of the usual line of their
duty, and that he knew they had a right to expect
extra pay for such extra work. The schooner contained
money, and his object was to get at it. If he
succeeded, their reward would be a doubloon a man,
which would be earning more than a month’s
wages by twenty-four hours’ work. This was
enough. The men wanted to hear no more; but
they cheered their commander, and set about their
task in the happiest disposition possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader will understand that the object to be
first achieved, was to raise a vessel, with a hold
filled with flour and gunpowder, from off the bottom
of the bay to its surface. As she stood, the deck of
this vessel was about six feet under water, and
every one will understand that her weight, so long
as it was submerged in a fluid as dense as that of
the sea, would be much more manageable than
if suspended in air. The barrels, for instance,
were not much heavier than the water they displaced,
and the wood work of the vessel itself, was,
on the whole, positively lighter than the element in
which it had sunk. As for the water in the hold,
that was of the same weight as the water on the
outside of the craft, and there had not been much to
carry the schooner down, beside her iron, the spars
that were out of water, and her ballast. This last,
some ten or twelve tons in weight, was in fact the
principal difficulty, and alone induced Spike to have
any doubts about his eventual success. There was
no foreseeing the result until he had made a trial,
however, and the order was again given to “heave
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the infinite satisfaction of the Swash’s crew,
the weight was found quite manageable, so long as
the hull remained beneath the water. Mulford,
with three or four assistants, was kept on board the
schooner lightening her, by getting the other anchor
off her bows, and throwing the different objects
overboard, or on the decks of the brig. By the time
the bulwarks reached the surface, as much was
gained in this way, as was lost by having so much
of the lighter wood-work rise above the water. As
a matter of course, however, the weight increased
as the vessel rose, and more especially as the lower
portion of the spars, the bowsprit, boom, &amp;c., from
being buoyant assistants, became so much dead
weight to be lifted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike kept a watchful eye on his spars, and the
extra supports he had given them. He was moving,
the whole time, from point to point, feeling
shrouds and back-stays, and preventers, in order to
ascertain the degree of strain on each, or examining
how the purchases stood. As for the crew, they
cheered at their toil, incessantly, passing from capstan
bars to the handspikes, and <span class='it'>vice versa</span>. They,
too, felt that their task was increasing in resistance
as it advanced, and now found it more difficult to
gain an inch, than it had been at first to gain a foot.
They seemed, indeed, to be heaving their own vessel
out, instead of heaving the other craft up, and it
was not long before they had the Swash heeling
over toward the wreck several streaks. The strain,
moreover, on every thing, became not only severe,
but somewhat menacing. Every shroud, back-stay
and preventer was as taut as a bar of iron, and the
chain-cable that led to the anchor planted off abeam,
was as straight as if the brig were riding by it in a
gale of wind. One or two ominous surges aloft,
too, had been heard, and, though no more than
straps and slings settling into their places under
hard strains, they served to remind the crew that
danger might come from that quarter. Such was
the state of things, when Spike called out to “heave
and pall,” that he might take a look at the condition
of the wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although a great deal remained to be done, in
order to get the schooner to float, a great deal had
already been done. Her precise condition was as
follows: Having no cabin widows, the water had
entered her, when she capsized, by the only four
apertures her construction possessed. These were
the companion-way, or cabin-doors; the sky-light;
the main-hatch, or the large inlet amid-ships, by
which cargo went up and down; and the booby-hatch,
which was the counterpart of the companion-way,
forward; being intended to admit of ingress to the
forecastle, the apartment of the crew. Each of
these hatch-ways, or orifices, had the usual defences
of “coamings,” strong frame-work around their margins.
These coamings rose six or eight inches
above the deck, and answered the double purpose
of strengthening the vessel, in a part, that without
them would be weaker than common, and of preventing
any water that might be washing about the
decks from running below. As soon, therefore, as
these three apertures, or their coamings, could be
raised above the level of the water of the basin, all
danger of the vessel’s receiving any further tribute
of that sort from the ocean would be over. It was
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
to this end, consequently, that Spike’s efforts had
been latterly directed, though they had only in part
succeeded. The schooner possessed a good deal of
sheer, as it is termed; or, her two extremities rose
nearly a foot above her centre, when on an even
keel. This had brought her extremities first to the
surface, and it was the additional weight which had
consequently been brought into the air, that had so
much increased the strain, and induced Spike to
pause. The deck forward, as far aft as the foremast,
and aft as far forward as the centre of the trunk, or
to the sky-light, was above the water, or at least
awash; while all the rest of it was covered. In the
vicinity of the main-hatch there were several inches
of water; enough indeed to leave the upper edge of
the coamings submerged by about an inch. To raise
the keel that inch by means of the purchases, Spike
well knew would cost him more labor, and would
incur more risk than all that had been done previously,
and he paused before he would attempt it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were now called from the brig and ordered
to come on board the schooner. Spike ascertained
by actual measurement how much was
wanted to bring the coamings of the main-hatch
above the water, until which was done, pumping
and bailing would be useless. He found it was
quite an inch, and was at a great loss to know how
that inch should be obtained. Mulford advised
another trial with the handspikes and bars, but to
this Spike would not consent. He believed that the
masts of the brig had already as much pressure on
them as they would bear. The mate next proposed
getting the main boom off the vessel, and to lighten
the craft by cutting away her bowsprit and masts.
The captain was well enough disposed to do this,
but he doubted whether it would meet with the approbation
of “Don Wan,” who was still ashore with
Rose and her aunt, and who probably looked forward
to recovering his gunpowder by means of
those very spars. At length the carpenter hit upon a
plan that was adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This plan was very simple, though it had its own
ingenuity. It will be remembered that water could
now only enter the vessel’s hold at the main-hatch,
all the other hatchways having their coamings above
the element. The carpenter proposed, therefore,
that the main-hatches, which had been off when the
tornado occurred, but which had been found on
deck when the vessel righted, should now be put
on, oakum being first laid along in their rabbetings,
and that the cracks should be stuffed with additional
oakum, to exclude as much water as possible. He
thought that two or three men, by using caulking
irons for ten minutes, would make the hatch-way so
tight that very little water would penetrate. While
this was doing, he himself would bore as many holes
forward and aft, as he could, with a two inch augur,
out of which the water then in the vessel would be
certain to run. Spike was delighted with this project,
and gave the necessary orders on the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This much must be said of the crew of the Molly
Swash—whatever they did in their own profession,
they did intelligently and well. On the present occasion
they maintained their claim to this character,
and were both active and expert. The hatches were
soon on, and, in an imperfect manner, caulked. While
this was doing, the carpenter got into a boat, and
going under the schooner’s bows, where a whole
plank was out of water, he chose a spot between
two of the timbers, and bored a hole as near the
surface of the water as he dared to do. Not satisfied
with one hole, however, he bored many—choosing
both sides of the vessel to make them,
and putting some aft as well as forward. In a word,
in the course of twenty minutes the schooner was
tapped in at least a dozen places, and jets of water,
two inches in diameter, were spouting from her on
each bow, and under each quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike and Mulford noted the effect. Some water,
doubtless, still worked itself into the vessel about
the main-hatch, but that more flowed from her by
means of the outlets just named, was quite apparent.
After close watching at the outlets for some time,
Spike was convinced that the schooner was slowly
rising, the intense strain that still came from the
brig producing that effect as the vessel gradually
became lighter. By the end of half an hour, there
could be no longer any doubt, the holes, which had
been bored within an inch of the water, being now
fully two inches above it. The augur was applied
anew, still nearer to the surface of the sea, and as
fresh outlets were made, those that began to
manifest a dulness in their streams were carefully
plugged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike now thought it was time to take a look at
the state of things on deck. Here, to his joy, he
ascertained that the coamings had actually risen
a little above the water. The reader is not to suppose
by this rising of the vessel, that she had become
sufficiently buoyant, in consequence of the water
that had run out of her, to float of herself! This
was far from being the case; but the constant upward
pressure from the brig, which, on mechanical
principles tended constantly to bring that craft upright,
had the effect to lift the schooner as the latter
was gradually relieved from the weight that pressed
her toward the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hatches were next removed, when it was
found that the water in the schooner’s hold had so far
lowered, as to leave a vacant space of quite a foot between
the lowest part of the deck and its surface.
Toward the two extremities of the vessel this space
necessarily was much increased, in consequence
of the sheer. Men were now sent into the hatchway
with orders to hook on to the flour-barrels—a whip
having been rigged in readiness to hoist them on
deck. At the same time gangs were sent to the
pumps, though Spike still depended for getting rid
of the water somewhat on the augur—the carpenter
continuing to bore and plug his holes as new opportunities
offered, and the old outlets became useless.
It was true this expedient would soon cease, for the
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
water having found its level in the vessel’s hold,
was very nearly on a level also with that on the
outside. Bailing also was commenced, both forward
and aft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike’s next material advantage was obtained by
means of the cargo. By the time the sun had set,
fully two hundred barrels had been rolled into the
hatchway, and passed on deck, whence, about half of
them, were sent in the light-house boat to the nearest
islet, and the remainder were transferred to the deck
of the brig. These last were placed on the off side
of the Swash, and aided in bringing her nearer upright.
A great deal was gained in getting rid of
these barrels. The water in the schooner lowered
just as much as the space they had occupied, and
the vessel was relieved at once of twenty tons in
weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just after the sun had set, Señor Don Juan Montefalderon
and his party returned on board. They
had staid on the island to the last moment, at Rose’s
request, for she had taken as close an observation
of every thing, as possible, in order to ascertain if
any means of concealment existed, in the event of
her aunt, Biddy, and herself quitting the brig. The
islets were all too naked and too small, however;
and she was compelled to return to the Swash,
without any hopes derived from this quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike had just directed the people to get their
suppers as the Mexican came on board. Together
they descended to the schooner’s deck, where they
had a long but secret conference. Señor Montefalderon
was a calm, quiet and reasonable man, and
while he felt as one would be apt to feel, who had
recently seen so many associates swept suddenly
out of existence, the late catastrophe did not in the
least unman him. It is too much the habit of the
American people to receive their impressions from
newspapers, which throw off their articles unreflectingly,
and often ignorantly, as crones in petticoats
utter their gossip. In a word, the opinions thus obtained
are very much on a level, in value, with the
thoughts of those who are said to think aloud, and
who give utterance to all the crudities and trivial
rumors that may happen to reach their ears. In
this manner, we apprehend, very false notions of
our neighbors of Mexico have become circulated
among us. That nation is a mixed race, and has
necessarily the various characteristics of such an
origin, and it is unfortunately little influenced by the
diffusion of intelligence which certainly exists here.
Although an enemy, it ought to be acknowledged,
however, that even Mexico has her redeeming
points. Anglo-Saxons as we are, we have no desire
to unnecessarily illustrate that very marked feature
in the Anglo-Saxon character, which prompts
the mother stock to calumniate all who oppose it,
but would rather adopt some of that chivalrous
courtesy of which so much that is lofty and commendable
is to be found among the descendants of
Old Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Señor Montefalderon was earnestly engaged
in what he conceived to be the cause of his country.
It was scarcely possible to bring together two men
impelled by motives more distinct than Spike and
this gentleman. The first was acting under impulses
of the lowest and most groveling nature;
while the last was influenced by motives of the
highest. However much Mexico may, and has,
weakened her cause by her own punic faith,
instability, military oppression, and political revolutions,
giving to the Texans in particular, ample
justification for their revolt, it was not probable that
Don Juan Montefalderon saw the force of all the
arguments that a casuist of ordinary ingenuity could
certainly adduce against his country; for it is a most
unusual thing to find a man any where, who is
willing to admit that the positions of an opponent
are good. He saw in the events of the day, a province
wrested from his nation; and, in his reasoning
on the subject, entirely overlooking the numerous
occasions on which his own fluctuating government
had given sufficient justification, not to say
motives, to their powerful neighbors, to take the
law into their own hands, and redress themselves;
he fancied all that has occurred was previously
planned, instead of regarding it, as it truly is, as
merely the result of political events, that no man
could have foreseen, that no man had originally
imagined, or that any man could control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan understood Spike completely, and quite
justly appreciated not only his character, but his
capabilities. Their acquaintance was not of a day,
though it had ever been marked by that singular
combination of caution and reliance that is apt to
characterize the intercourse between the knave and
the honest man, when circumstances compel not
only communication, but, to a certain extent, confidence.
They now paced the deck of the schooner,
side by side, for fully an hour, during which time
the price of the vessel, the means, and the mode of
payment and transfer, were fully settled between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what will you do with your passengers, Don
Esteban?” asked the Mexican pleasantly, when the
more material points were adjusted. “I feel a great
interest in the young lady in particular, who is a
charming señorita, and who tells me that her aunt
brought her this voyage on account of her health.
She looks much too blooming to be out of health,
and if she were, this is a singular voyage for an
invalid to make!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand human natur’ yet, altogether,
I see, Don Wan,” answered Spike, chuckling
and winking. “As you and I are not only good
friends, but what a body may call <span class='it'>old</span> friends, I’ll
let you into a secret in this affair, well knowing that
you’ll not betray it. It’s quite true that the old
woman thinks her niece is a pulmonory, as they call
it, and that this v’y’ge is recommended for her, but
the gal is as healthy as she’s handsom’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her constitution, then, must be very excellent,
for it is seldom I have seen so charming a young
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
woman. But if the aunt is misled in this matter,
how has it been with the niece?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike did not answer in words, but he leered upon
his companion, and he winked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to be understood that you are in intelligence
with each other, I suppose, Don Esteban,”
returned the Señor Montefalderon, who did not like
the captain’s manner, and was willing to drop the
discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike then informed his companion, in confidence,
that he and Rose were affianced, though without
the aunt’s knowledge. That he intended to marry
the niece the moment he reached a Mexican port
with the brig, and that it was their joint intention to
settle in the country. He added that the affair required
management, as his intended had property,
and expected more, and he begged Don Juan to
aid him, as things drew near to a crisis. The Mexican
evaded an answer, and the discourse dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was now shining, and would continue
to throw its pale light over the scene for two or three
hours longer. Spike profited by the circumstance
to continue the work of lightening the schooner.
One of the first things done next was to get up the
dead, and to remove them to the boat. This melancholy
office occupied an hour, the bodies being
landed on the islet, near the powder, and there
interred in the sands. Don Juan Montefalderon
attended on this occasion, and repeated some prayers
over the graves, as he had done in the morning,
in the cases of the two who had been buried near
the light-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this melancholy duty was in the course of
performance, that of pumping and bailing was continued,
under the immediate personal superintendance
of Mulford. It would not be easy to define,
with perfect clearness, the conflicting feelings by
which the mate of the Swash was now impelled.
He had no longer any doubt on the subject of
Spike’s treason, and had it not been for Rose, he
would not have hesitated a moment about making
off in the light-house boat for Key West, in order
to report all that had passed to the authorities. But
not only Rose <span class='it'>was</span> there, and to be cared for, but
what was far more difficult to get along with, her
aunt was with her. It is true Mrs. Budd was no
longer Spike’s dupe; but under any circumstances
she was a difficult subject to manage, and most
especially so in all matters that related to the sea.
Then the young man submitted, more or less, to the
strange influence which a fine craft almost invariably
obtains over those that belong to her.
He did not like the idea of deserting the Swash, at
the very moment he would not have hesitated about
punishing her owner for his many misdeeds. In a
word, Harry was too much of a tar not to feel a
deep reluctance to turn against his cruise, or his
voyage, however much either might be condemned
by his judgment, or even by his principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite nine o’clock when the Señor Montefalderon
and Spike returned from burying the dead.
No sooner did the last put his foot on the deck of
his own vessel, than he felt the fall of one of the
purchases which had been employed in raising the
schooner. It was so far slack as to satisfy him that
the latter now floated by her own buoyancy, though
it might be well to let all stand until morning, for
the purposes of security. Thus apprised of the condition
of the two vessels, he gave the welcome order
to “knock-off for the night.”</p>

<p class='line0'>Reflecting back pale evening’s ray,</p>
<p class='line0'>When stealthily two lovers came</p>
<p class='line0'>And leaned beside its silent frame:</p>
<p class='line0'>“Mute marker of the moments’ flight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! dial, tell us of the night!”</p>

<p class='line0'>Again the youth and maiden sighed:</p>
<p class='line0'>“Mute marker of the moments’ flight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! dial, tell us of the night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just been visiting Miss Agnes Lincoln,”
said my young friend Kate Wilson to me one morning.
“Truly, Miss Enna, she is the most charming
woman I have ever known—always excepting, of
course, your own dear self. Though no longer
young, she is still beautiful—intelligent, clever,
without the slightest tinge of pedantry; gentle and
loveable. Why is it that she has never married?
She has been a devoted daughter and sister; I have
always felt surprise and regret that she should not
have been a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone of voice told the regret which those
words expressed, and caused me to smile as I
looked at my bright-eyed friend, who, being on the
eve of marriage herself with one she loved very
dearly, thought, of course, the married state the
only true vocation for a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Kate,” I replied, “Agnes Lincoln has always
had duties sufficient to employ her in her
home circle—her heart has been too much occupied
with providing for the comfort of her brothers and
sisters, and nursing a poor invalid mother, to go out
on voyages, in order to seek a fellow heart, or to
attend to the said fellow heart, should it come wooing.
Only unoccupied, free-from-care bodies, like
your sweet self, can find time to fall in love and
marry⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” said the blushing Kate, “do not
tease me with such <span class='it'>badinage</span>. I wish you would
tell me Miss Lincoln’s history—romantic I have
already determined it is—for those deep, dark eyes
of hers give evidences, by their bright flashings at
times, of the existence of a fount of passion, which,
I am sure, must have welled up and bubbled over
at some period of her life. You have known her
intimately from girlhood, Miss Duval, come, tell me
the tale. See, it is the very time for a long story,
we are certain of being alone, no stupid visiters
will interrupt us, for those threatening, overhanging
clouds are already beginning to let down their
watery contents—the fire snaps and sparkles in a
most sociable manner, and I will spend the whole
day with you in this cheery little room of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly she threw aside her bonnet and
shawl—pushed what she called “the troublesome
desk, and still more wearying work-basket,” away
from me, then throwing herself on a low ottoman
beside me, looked most persuasively into my face
for the web of romance she was determined I should
weave, and with the air of one determined not to
be denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you deserve, Kate,” I said, “that I should
entertain you, when you seem to think so slightingly
of the mission of my sisterhood? Saucy girl!
are old maids always to be regarded by such
sparkling, merry witches like yourself, as leading
lives useless to both man and womankind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, dear Miss Enna,” exclaimed the lovely
girl, as she gathered her graceful limbs on her
favorite seat beside me, in order to make her dear
little luxurious form still more comfortable, gazing
into my face with her bright dancing eyes, and holding
my hands caressingly, “Heaven knows, I have
had need to bless the sisterhood, for what would I
have been without such a dear, good, kind—” I
stopped her rosy flattering lips with my hand, and
yielded to her request. Kate Wilson promised to
be lenient should my story have less of interest and
romance in it than she expected—will you, my
dear reader, be as merciful and indulgent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Kate said, I had known Agnes Lincoln from
girlhood—yes, babyhood—for we had been introduced
by our proud, happy mothers to each other,
in our first long dresses, and had taken infinite delight,
so our nurses had said, in tearing the blue and
pink cockades off of each other’s caps. We were
always warm friends; went to the same schools,
and, as our parents were intimate, when we grew
up visited in the same circles. Agnes’ father was
the senior member of one of the most opulent firms
in the city—his wealth was said to be immense,
and truly they lived in a style of princely magnificence.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
She was the eldest of several children.
The three next to her died in infancy, which made
quite a difference between her and the other children
in point of age. Her mother was a woman
of exceedingly delicate frame, and sickness and
the distress she had suffered on losing her children,
weakened still more a mind never very strong. I
always remember her as an invalid—surrounded
by every luxury wealth could purchase; possessing
a doting husband and a family of noble children;
yet always repining and melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes had been educated by her father with
exceeding great care; and as she grew up was a
most agreeable companion for him. He accompanied
her into society; they studied, rode, drove and
walked together; indeed one could rarely see them
apart. How proud was he of her; and he lavished
every costly gift upon her with an unsparing hand.
She was beautiful—a tall, splendid looking creature—a
fine erect figure, with the bearing of a
queen, and a head fitted for a Zenobia—but the
classic severity of her features was softened by
the most melting, lovely eyes, and the gentle melodious
tones of her voice were bewitching. Beautiful,
rich and young, of course Agnes Lincoln was a
belle. She had been full two years in society, and
to the surprise of her friends she was still disengaged.
“I shall never marry, Enna,” she would
say to me, in answer to my playful reproaches upon
her want of susceptibility—“how could my poor
mother or lonely father spare me?” and at last I
began to think, as many others did, that Agnes was
one of those born to a life of “single blessedness,”
when</p>

<p class='noindent'>became known to her. Agnes’ choice surprised us all.
Evart Berkely was a young merchant reputed
wealthy, but not at all agreeable or pleasing to my
fancy. He was handsome and tolerably intelligent—had
been well educated and had traveled abroad,
bringing with him from his travels various “foreign
airs and graces,” which did not improve his agreeability
to my taste. He was certainly much inferior
to Agnes in point of intellect; but she loved him
nevertheless. I always thought him a cold, calculating
man, and the passionate love he expressed
for my beautiful friend seemed so unnatural, falling
from his cold unexpressive lips. Mr. Lincoln was at
first as much dissatisfied and surprised at Agnes’
choice as the rest of her friends; but when he discovered
how completely her whole heart was given
up to this infatuation, as he could make no serious
objection to the gentleman, he quickly quieted all
expressions of disapprobation, and only stipulated
that their engagement should be a long one, pleading
his wife’s health and his own lonely state as excuses.
The lover, of course, was impatient at these
obstacles, but Agnes, always alive to her father’s
happiness, steadily refused to shorten the period of
two years, decided upon by her father. Evart was
a devoted lover, and seemed to exist only in the
presence of his mistress; and dear Agnes was so
supremely happy—I fancifully imagined her beauty
increased under this new influence of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been engaged to Evart Berkely about
a year, when one evening we all met at Mr. Lincoln’s,
on our way to a gay private ball. I had
always gone into society with Agnes and Mr.
Lincoln; for my mother dying while I was quite a
young girl, my father had been so deeply affected
by her death—as she had been to him companion,
guide, and comforter—that he avoided all society,
and sought consolation in close application to his
profession. He had been from boyhood on the
closest terms of intimacy with Mr. Lincoln, and
willingly consented that I should accompany Agnes
on her entrance into society, under Mr. Lincoln’s
care. Accordingly, on the night I allude to, I had
been driven to Mr. Lincoln’s, that I might be one of
their party. I particularize this one evening, for it
was the most eventful night of Agnes’ life—the
turning point in her existence. Events occurred
on that night which gave the stamp and impress to
her future. I remember thinking, as I looked upon
her, after the completion of her toilette, that I had
never seen her so magnificently beautiful. Her
father and lover were rather gorgeous in their
tastes, and to please them Agnes always dressed
with more splendor than accorded with her own
fancy; but the peculiar style of her beauty was well
suited to this manner of dressing. Her tall, full
form could well bear the heavy folds of rich drapery
that always swept around her, and the brilliant
jewels that gleamed and flashed in her dark hair,
and on her snowy throat and arms, were admitted
by even the most fastidious to be in good taste.
She was the daughter of a reputed <span class='it'>millionaire</span>,
beautiful and noble-looking—costly garments and
rich gems seemed well fitted for her. It was a
grand ball we were going to, and after spending
the accustomed half hour in Mr. Lincoln’s library,
he gave us into Evart Berkely’s charge. Agnes
entreated her father to accompany her with more
than her customary earnestness; but he pleaded
indolence, and laughingly reminded her that her
lover’s presence should be sufficient. I could not
account for the tinge of sadness that gloomed over
her features; and when Evart and I rallied her on
her absence of mind, during our drive to the ball,
she frankly confessed her feelings were unaccountable,
and said she had been suffering all day from a
vague, indefinable sense of approaching evil. We
cheered her, and attributed her feelings to nervousness;
what evil could one so prosperous and happy
have to fear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As usual, she was the centre of attraction, and
crowds followed her. Evart hovered around her incessantly,
and her quiet, happy looks, as she received
his attentions, so openly offered, were to me most
fascinating. Her sadness and home yearnings
seemed to melt before the bright light of the ball-room,
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
and the merry laughter and gay looks of her
friends, put to flight all gloomy thoughts. I thought
I had never heard her voice so melodious, her laugh
more buoyant, nor her dancing so graceful; she appeared
as the embodiment of happiness. During
the course of the evening, I was standing alone by a
window, in a recess, that opened into a conservatory,
almost, if not quite, hidden by the folds of the
drapery, enjoying, in a sort of dreamy state, the
rich odors of the flowers, and the bewitching strains
of the music. The movements of the crowd brought
two old gentlemen directly in front of me, in such a
manner that I could not have moved if I had wished
from my hiding-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hugh Lincoln’s daughter is a beautiful creature,”
said one to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is, indeed,” replied the friend, “and she
dresses like a sultana—look at her magnificent
gems and gorgeous clothing. Hugh Lincoln has
been a fortunate man, and his daughter will be a
rich wife for the one that marries her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May be so, and may be not,” said the first
speaker; “one cannot tell how a man’s estate may
turn out while still engaged in business. Hugh
Lincoln has been a bold, daring merchant; he
always incurs fearful risks, and although he has
hitherto been fortunate, one turning of luck may
sweep all his grandeur from him—for he perils all
on every great speculation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is engaged,” said the friend, “to young
Berkely, who is so constantly with her. He is a
shrewd, calculating fellow; one might feel certain of
Hugh Lincoln’s wealth by the mere knowledge of
that engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A movement of the crowd took place, and the
two worldly old croakers, as I deemed them, passed
away. I kept my place, and my thoughts were
filled with Agnes and her future. Vague forebodings
pressed upon me, and all my old dislike and
distrust of Evart returned to me. Low passionate
murmurings of love came next upon my ear.
Evart and Agnes stood beside me with the heavy
folds of the curtain between us, and I became again
an unintentional listener. Evart poured out the
most fervent expressions of love—he besought my
friend to delay their wedding no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think, my idolized one,” he murmured, “how
long has been my probation already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Evart,” replied Agnes, steadily, “do not
urge me. My father, who, from my earliest recollection
has been devoted to my happiness, asks me
to delay my marriage. I will not act against his
wishes. It would be but a poor promise for our
future happiness were I to be thus regardless of my
father’s comfort. Adel is too young to supply my
place to him for a year or two yet. We are together
constantly, and a year will soon pass around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the coming year may see you wedded to
another,” exclaimed her lover passionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evart,” said Agnes, reproachfully, “have I not
promised to be your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Agnes,” replied Evart, in hurried words,
“suppose sorrow were to overtake me—men in
business are daily exposed to ruin—what then could
I depend on? Your father would never consent to
your marriage with a bankrupt; and to my troubles
would be added the fearful necessity of yielding you
up forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say not so, dear Evart,” replied Agnes, in
earnest, loving tones; “in the hour of trouble you
would be dearer to me, if possible, than now. I
have promised to be your wife—I hold that promise
sacred, believe me; and, moreover, I know
my father’s generous nature too well to think as
you do—in misfortune he would be kinder to you
than in prosperity. But why talk of misfortune—are
there any clouds on your business horizon?
Come, tell me your troubles, and if you are, indeed,
on the eve of bankruptcy, which Heaven avert,
seek advice from my father; never fear, Evart, he
will willingly assist you; and if it would lighten
your heart in the midst of such affliction, I would be
your wife instantly; in such a case my father would
no longer object—you would need the consoling
society of a wife more than he would need his
daughter;” and Agnes’ face wore a look of mingled
affection and anxiety as she took his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly,” exclaimed Evart, laughing, “I have half
a mind to declare myself a bankrupt, if it would
have that effect. But do not look so anxiously, my
blessed one—my affairs are in a most prosperous
condition. I was wrong to alarm you, yet it proved
to me your love, dearest, which, indeed, I sometimes
am weak enough to doubt. I torment myself
with a thousand fancies. You are so beautiful,
Agnes, so superior—I so unworthy of you, that I am
always fearing a change in your feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that is really unkind, Evart,” was Agnes’
reproachful answer; “am I prone to changing—who
have I ever loved but you? You should not be thus
suspicious, or you will make me fearful of change,
not in myself but in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed from Evart the most fervent, passionate
declarations, which were interrupted by the
approach of some friends, who came to seek their
assistance in forming a favorite dance; and I
escaped from my hiding-place. I was so intimate
with Agnes—her second self, as she playfully called
me—that I felt no annoyance at having been forced
to play the listener to her love scene; on the contrary,
congratulated myself that no stranger, or mere
acquaintance, had been in my place. I descended
from the steps of the window into the conservatory,
and spent a full hour in examining the beautiful
plants—imagining myself in fairy land. The pure,
beautiful light shed from the alabaster vases, which,
containing lamps, were placed in different parts of
the conservatory; the bewitching tones of music
that came sweeping from the ball-room, and the soft
night air that poured in from the open, outer windows,
all heightened the illusion, and I fancied I
was listening to the divine spirit-melody of the
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
flower-sylphs, and inhaling their balmy atmosphere.
How every moment of that night is impressed upon
my memory; every word, every change of feeling—all
were treasured up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was roused from my delicious reveries by Agnes
and Evart, who came to announce to me it was
time to retire. “As usual,” said Agnes, tenderly
putting her arm around me, “I find you dreaming
waking visions among the flowers. I fear my sad
thoughts, dear Enna, have flown to you. I was so
full of vague forebodings, when I left home, and
now they have all vanished. I am as happy and
light-hearted as I have ever been in my life; every
thing around me seems to wear a fairy, heavenly
hue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus she chatted away during our drive home.
We bade her good night at Mr. Lincoln’s door, and
the carriage drove away, bearing us to our own
homes—one short half-hour after, and the same carriage
bore me back again to that house in deep
affliction. Agnes, after bidding us good night,
entered the hall, and was proceeding up the stair-case
to her own room, when, as she passed the
library, she saw the library light still burning, which
was to her a notice of her father’s waiting up for her
return. She entered with a light heart and a merry
song. Her father was seated in his chair, leaning
his head forward on his reading-desk, apparently
asleep. She bent over him to awaken him by
gentle caresses, but ere her lips touched his brow,
the expression of his face startled her. She gave
one long, searching look, then uttered a piercing
shriek of agony, which startled the whole house.
He was dead. There, in that solitary room, his
spirit had taken flight, alone, without daughter or
friend beside him to receive his parting words of
love. Poor Agnes! with what agony she leaned
over him—vainly calling on him to speak to her—to
look, if only once more, upon his own Agnes.
It was a sad sight—this beautiful girl bending over
her dead father—her rich drapery falling heavily
around her, and her magnificent hair, which had
escaped from the circlet of gems which bound it,
swept the ground, making her pale face appear still
more pallid, as its heavy, dark masses hung over
her fair shoulders. Her earnest, heart-rending appeals
were terrifying; not a tear flowed from her
dark eyes—they seemed distended with agony; and
the physicians who had been hastily summoned
feared that the shock would deprive her of reason,
if not of life. I at last succeeded in leading her
away from her father, and, exhausted by her intense
grief, she lay for hours in a heavy stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every means were resorted to, to restore Mr.
Lincoln—but all in vain. The physicians, after an
examination, decided that he had labored under an
affection of the heart, unconsciously, for some time;
that he had been on the brink of the grave for many
months, undoubtedly—he, who had seemed so
healthy; and this it was which had caused his
death, which they thought had taken place some
time before Agnes’ return, and with little or no
suffering, possibly without a consciousness of the
approaching fearful change. Poor Agnes! her sufferings
were intense, but her naturally strong mind,
and strict sense of duty, aided her, when in the
morning, after the heavy stupor of exhaustion had
passed away, the fearful consciousness of her great
sorrow arose vividly before her. She recollected
there were others to suffer, who were weaker to
bear—her poor invalid mother, and fatherless
brothers and sisters. She wept long and bitterly,
when her eyes opened upon my tearful, anxious
face, as I bent over her. I blessed those tears, for I
knew they would relieve her. She at last, however,
bowed meekly to the burden imposed upon
her, and hastened to soothe and comfort her almost
heart-broken mother, and the poor startled, weeping
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody grieved for Mr. Lincoln, for he was
much beloved; “but,” said the out-of-doors world,
“how fortunate are his family, possessing wealth in
the midst of their sorrow. Mr. Lincoln has left
them an immense fortune to comfort them in their
affliction;” as if money could compensate for the loss
of loved ones. Agnes would have gladly toiled for
their daily bread to have purchased one look from
those eyes closed in death, one accent of love from
those cold, livid lips. After the funeral, Mr. Lincoln’s
will was opened. It was one made three or four
years previous to his death; and my father was one
of the executors, and sole guardian to the children.
This will had been made previous to Agnes’ engagement;
but in it Mr. Lincoln expressed a wish,
almost a command, that if ever Agnes married, my
father should insist upon having the greater part of
her immense fortune settled upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week or two passed by, when one evening my
father returned home from his office, later than usual,
and his face wore an anxious, troubled expression.
Some case of more than ordinary misery and sadness,
I thought, has come before him, in which fate
has woven a darker weft of trouble. I hastened to
procure for him the soothing cup of tea, which he
so much loved, and sat beside his chair, as he
silently despatched his light meal, expecting every
moment to hear the new tale of human suffering—but
I was disappointed; my father drank his tea
quietly, and it was not until the tea-service was removed,
and I seated at my sewing-table beside his
large arm-chair, that the good, kind old man broke
the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enna, my child,” he said, in gloomy tones, “poor
Agnes Lincoln, her mother and those fatherless
children are penniless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Penniless—impossible!” I exclaimed. “I thought
Mr. Hugh Lincoln was admitted to be immensely
wealthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His immense wealth,” said my father, “proves
to be a magnificent dream—a shining bubble. He
must have been lamentably ignorant of his own
affairs, for things have evidently been going wrong
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
for some months past. Such wild, mad-cap speculations
as the house have engaged in, I am sure my
sensible, prudent friend would never have countenanced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now understood the allusions of the old gentleman,
in the first conversation which I had overheard
in the ball-room, the night of Mr. Lincoln’s fearful
death, and I repeated them to my father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” he replied, “daring indeed have
been their operations, and not only that, but reckless
and wild in the extreme. I remember now,
although I gave but little heed at the time, noticing
in Hugh Lincoln, for some months past, a heavy,
growing indolence, as I deemed it. It must have
proceeded from his fatal disease, and he has left the
affairs of the concern in the hands of the junior
partners, who have mismanaged not only wildly but
wickedly. Poor fellow! he has been spared the
sorrow, but what is to become of the poor invalid
widow and orphans? Six little helpless creatures
beside Agnes—Adel is not more than fourteen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scarcely thirteen,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor creatures!” exclaimed my father, brushing
a tear aside. “But we must do all that we can
for them. I am a poor man, but what little I
have shall be freely shared with Hugh Lincoln’s
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, my dear father,” I said, “that Agnes
is engaged to Evart Berkely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” replied my father. “But, Enna, I have
very little confidence in him; I only hope Agnes
may not love him too dearly, for I very much fear
that Evart’s love is rather too weak to bear the
present news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he know of the insolvency of the firm?”
I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said my father, “the mere suspicion
of the insolvency of such a firm as Lincoln, Murray
&amp; Co., would of course spread like wild-fire. I
never dreamed of such a thing myself, however,
and heard this morning with great surprise, on
going to my office, from an old merchant, that it had
been rumored for several days. You must break it
to Agnes, poor girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think Evart Berkely knows of it?” I said,
after a long silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” replied my father, “I met him in company
with some other merchants this afternoon, and
he spoke of Mr. Lincoln only as he would of any
other well-known merchant, and united in self
congratulations with some others as to being unaffected,
fortunately, by the failure—not at all in the
tone of one interested in his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation between Agnes and Evart returned
to my memory, and I contrasted his feelings
with hers—how differently would she have acted
had he been overtaken by poverty. “But,” said I
to myself in the morning, when preparing for my
customary visit to Agnes, “it may be but fancy
after all—we may be wronging Evart; he did not
choose to exhibit his feelings before a crowd of
men,” and with this consolatory conclusion, I set
out on my walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ascended the broad steps of Agnes’ noble residence,
and passed through the wide hall and up the
spacious stair-case, noting the magnificence of the
furniture with a sigh. I entered the library, where
I was told I would find Agnes. It was a grand,
noble room, and in its adornments proved that immense
wealth had been guided by the subduing
hand of taste. It was lighted from above; the brick-and-mortar
world without was completely unknown
in that stately room; only the blue sky by day, and
the bright stars by night, could be seen. The soft,
unworldly light gleamed down on beautiful works
of art, rare and costly pieces of sculpture, medals,
gems, and here and there alcoves filled with the
productions of those whom the intellectual world
call Masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paused at the threshold unheard by Agnes, who
was writing at an escritoir—my eyes wandered
over this intellectual Paradise and then rested upon
the Eve. I was struck with the impression of her
face; it bore a more beaming, hopeful look than I
had seen on it since the night of her father’s death.
“Poor girl!” I sighed to myself, “how soon is that
brilliant expression to be dimmed by the care-clouds
of life—not only heart trials, but poverty, privation,
and, worse than all to your noble spirit—dependence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I moved forward, but the luxurious carpet told no
tales of my foot-falls, and my hand rested on her
shoulder ere she was aware of my entrance. She
looked up, and her eyes were gleaming with tears—not
tears of sadness—and a bright flush rested on
her hitherto pale cheeks; I looked surprised, and
she noting it said in trembling tones,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! dear Enna, I never valued the possession
of wealth before. Read this letter, dearest, while I
finish the answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took from her hands an open letter—it was from
Evart, written the previous night, announcing anticipated
severe and heavy losses, and freeing her
from her engagement—he could not, he said, ask
her to wed a penniless man—and after lamenting
in a fine round period his unworthiness of her, his
misery and <a id='wret'></a>wretchedness, concluded with a farewell
forever. After I concluded the note, I felt that my
father was right, my hands dropped before me, and
for a few moments I felt as in a dream—a spell was
over me—I could not tell my poor wronged friend
the real truth—at last she broke the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Enna,” were her words, “I bless Heaven
I have enough for both. My share of my poor
father’s princely fortune will fully cover his losses,
and again establish him in life. How unkind and
yet how natural is his note—poor Evart! I can
fancy his wretchedness when releasing me from
my engagement—and he must have known it was
useless—but I cannot censure him—even thus
would I have acted had the loss of fortune happened
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
“Would you, dear Agnes?” said I, throwing my
arms over her beautiful neck caressingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed would I, Enna,” she replied sadly. “It
would have been a hard duty, but steadily would I
have performed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agnes,” I said, in low, earnest tones, inwardly
imploring for assistance and strength in my painful
task, “that duty is required of you. You are the
penniless one instead of Evart. He is as prosperous
as ever, but you, my poor friend, are bereft of all—but
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed wildly at me, then with one low wailing
cry of deep agony became insensible. She was
laid on her couch, surrounded by all the appliances
of wealth so soon to be taken from her, and the
heavy stupor that hung over her spirit the bitter
hours after her father’s death ensued. But I knew
her inward strength, and although I could scarcely
pray for her recovery to such misery as would be
hers, I felt that the helpless ones dependent on her
for consolation would, as in the former dark hours,
sustain her. The heavy clouds passed over, and
she at last aroused her suffering broken spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the letters?” she murmured in low
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One I destroyed, dearest,” I replied—“the
other⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Destroy it likewise, Enna, and help me to forget.
I have others to think of now,” and with a
quiet look of repressed agony she hastily employed
herself in preparing for their future change of circumstances.
Evart was never alluded to by any
one; and day after day she engaged herself in entering
into the investigation of her father’s affairs,
with the firm, quiet air of a woman of business.
The investigation proved only the painful truth—ruin,
hopeless ruin stared them in the face—every
thing was swept from them. Poor Mrs. Lincoln
had seemed overwhelmed with sorrow at her husband’s
death, but this new grief appeared to her
weak, indolent nature still harder to bear, and she
helplessly implored to be taken from life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For myself, dear Mr. Duval,” said my friend, in
a calm voice, but the tones of which showed repressed
suffering, “I care not—I can endure hardships—but
my poor mother, how can she bear the
change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will all come to us, dear Agnes, and we
will be as one family,” said my kind father, as they
at last ended the careful examination of the affairs.
“You and Enna have always been as sisters, my
poor dead wife loved your mother as a sister. The
income my profession yields you and Enna can
manage so as to supply us all. We will live plainly
but happily, I know. You are both sufficiently well
informed to educate the girls, and Adel will soon be
old enough to assist you. Horace and Frank will
in a few years be able to help themselves, and supply
my place when I grow too old to fill the purse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes sat by the table quietly gazing as upon
vacancy, when my dear, good father commenced his
kind plan, and as he proceeded her dark eyes beamed
with childlike fondness on the good old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely Heaven will bless you and yours, dear
Mr. Duval, for being thus kind to the widowed and
fatherless,” she exclaimed, as he concluded. “But
I must not accept your kind offer. Your plan, however,
has confirmed me in the scheme I have been
forming for some days past. If I am sufficiently well
fitted to take charge of my sisters’ education, why
not of others? If you will aid me I will open a school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought was a good one, and my father, finding
Agnes steady in her determination yielded, and
used every endeavor to forward her in her project.
The creditors had refused to accept the costly wardrobe
and magnificent jewels belonging to Mrs. Lincoln
and Agnes. These were disposed of, and the
money arising from their sale was appropriated by
Agnes to the furnishing of her new establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take this money only as a loan,” said Agnes
to my father. “If I am spared, and have health
and strength, at some future time it shall be returned.
I never shall feel light-hearted until my father’s liabilities
are all satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A house was procured, every thing arranged for
the opening of the school; and it was announced in
society, that the Miss Lincoln who had been “the
glass of fashion and the mould of form,” a few short
months before, was about to enter the work-day
world as a teacher. Much is said and much written
about summer-friends—those who hover around
the favorites of fortune, then flee from them in the
dark hour of sorrow—but truly I have seen but
little of such heartlessness, long as I have lived in
the world. People do not wish to desert those who
are in trouble. There is more of kindness of heart
and sympathy in the world than we are willing to
give credit for. Circumstances and events press
so quickly in this life of change, that when one
amongst us is stricken down, although we grieve,
we are urged on in the stream, and though we
would gladly aid our sinking companion, we are
hurried on unconsciously. But let the stricken one
give signs of life—evidences of aiding itself, then
all are ready to give a helping hand. The race
must be completed—life’s journey accomplished—but
any one exhibiting a desire to unite in the
struggle is willingly assisted. So was it with the
friends of Agnes Lincoln. Had she weakly yielded
to her troubles, and shown no disposition to aid
herself, the world would have felt sorry for her, but
they would have had no time to tarry by the way-side—but
when she appeared amongst them prepared
to take her part in life’s great contest, they
willingly united to help her forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes Lincoln’s accomplishments, her elegant
manners—her strong mind, all her good qualities,
were remembered; and mothers and fathers,
who had admired the beautiful girl in society,
hastened to place under her care their own
daughters, asking that she might make them like
her own lovely self, and they would be satisfied.
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
She entered heart and soul into her new vocation;
and hers became the most popular establishment in
the city. In the course of two or three years the
small house had to be changed, and a residence as
large as her father’s princely mansion taken, in order
to accommodate her large school. The luxurious
comforts, necessary to her mother’s happiness, were
gratified; her brothers and sisters carefully attended
to; but her own wants were few, indeed. She was
most carefully and studiously economical. Every
year she deposited in my father’s hands, a sum of
money, small at first, but gradually increasing, which
she, with a sad smile, called her father’s fund; this
was devoted to the settling off the remaining accounts
against her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noble creature! how every one revered her as
she moved steadily on in the path of her duty.
Hers was not an easy life; hard mental labor, from
morning till night, she endured for many years. At
day-dawn she was up, superintending her household,
and directing the studies of those pupils who
resided with her. The influence she exercised over
those entrusted to her care, was a subject of remark.
Her commands were insisted upon with words of
love, but looks of firmness. Her girls hovered
around her, quietly watching every glance; and in
that whole troop of young, thoughtless creatures,
the most of them the indulged, spoiled children of
fortune, not one but would have dreaded to disobey
the simplest request of their gentle teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We met daily, as formerly, and I still was to her
the confidante and bosom friend I had been in the
days of her wealth. She never spoke of Evart—we
both avoided all allusion to him; and when, a few
years after their separation, he married a wealthy
woman from a neighboring city, and his marriage
was mentioned before her, by those who knew not
of her former connection with him, or else had forgotten
it, a mere acquaintance could not have detected
any trace or evidence of feeling. The marble
paleness of her cheek, the firm closed mouth, and
quiet, but sad look, which told of inward suffering,
betrayed to me, however, that her thoughts were
with the past, and I noticed in her, for some time
after, a closer attendance to her duties—not one
moment, night or day, left unoccupied; and her
brow bore a more serious expression, that told of
self-combatings and heart-struggles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Year after year passed, and Agnes had the satisfaction
of seeing her sisters growing up charming
women, admired in society, and her two brothers
displaying the good qualities, and honorable, high
spirits of their father. By her exertions they were
educated; and ten years after her father’s death she
paid off his last debt, and had the pleasure of seeing
her eldest brother, Horace, who had just completed
his studies, enter his profession as a partner with
my father. The little Frank, her father’s darling,
would be nothing but a merchant, as his father had
been, and was dreaming seventeen-year-old visions
of future grandeur, such as his father had probably
dreamed at his age, and realized. He would wreath
his mother’s fretful, complaining countenance with
smiles, as he would describe the wealth he intended
to accumulate, and the splendid things that should
once more be hers. Two weddings were celebrated
by Agnes—her two sisters, Adel and Mary, who
married upright and warm-hearted men, prosperous
in business; and Agnes felt almost a maternal pride
as she furnished their houses, and provided the wedding
wardrobes. The world wondered she did not
marry, for her beauty never left her, nor were opportunities
wanting. Many a fond, widowed father
would have gladly persuaded the idolized teacher of
their daughters to share their fortunes; but she
calmly and quietly refused all offers, and seemed at
last to find real happiness in her business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen years passed by, and found Agnes still at
her post. One only of those little ones, bequeathed
by a loving father to her care, remained under her
roof—and she was soon to leave Agnes to become
a wife. All were married, happy, and well. The
poor old mother had at last ceased all wailings, and
had laid down to her long rest, when a new care
devolved upon Agnes. Evart Berkely, who had
appeared for years to be a prosperous man, and
thought by many to possess great wealth, suddenly
failed, and in a moment of despair put a violent end
to his existence. His wife had died some five or
six years before, many said of a broken-heart; and
his three children were left upon the world homeless
orphans. Evart left a letter, commending his
children to Agnes, who, he said, had promised to
be a mother to his children, should they ever need
her care. Then was disclosed what Agnes had
kept a secret. A year after his wife’s death, he had
again sought Agnes; but his overtures were indignantly
rejected by her; he continued his addresses
by letters for some time, until Agnes refused to
receive them, returning them unopened, saying,
however, in her final note, that, should his children
ever be left alone in life, she would be a mother to
them; and to her home did she take those helpless
ones, and devoted herself to her business with renewed
energy to provide for their support and future
establishment in life. People shrugged their shoulders,
and called her conduct Quixotic and absurd,
but the good and kind-hearted applauded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my young friend, Kate Wilson, requested
me to relate the history of Agnes, forty-five years
had stealthily crept over her, but even the bitter,
bleak winters of her adversity had failed to whiten
her dark locks, or dim those beaming eyes—time
had dealt gently with her beauty. Evart’s children
have proved as blessings to her, and by them, and
by her brothers and sisters, and by their children,
Agnes is revered almost as a saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Kate, Kate,” I said, as I arrived at this part
of my “<span class='it'>ower true tale</span>,” “has not Agnes Lincoln’s
lot, as an old maid, been quite as useful, and still
more happy, than she would have been as Evart
Berkely’s broken-hearted wife?”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>WITH AN ENGRAVING.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have thought proper, in conducting a magazine of
higher reputation and aim than the usual run of the
light periodicals of the day, to devote a part of the pictorial
department to pictures of American Scenery and Indian
Portraiture, as better fitted to give the work a permanent
value in libraries and on centre-tables, than the ordinary
catch-penny pictures which disgrace a number of the magazines.
Our illustrations of Southern and Western Scenery
have commanded the respect and support of a very large
class of readers; and the constantly growing celebrity and
profit of Graham’s Magazine, indicate that we have judged
wisely and well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have engaged the services of Mr. Bird, the author of
“Nick of the Woods,” “Calavar,” etc., to furnish us a
series of articles upon the Indians of America; a writer
whose intimate acquaintance with the subject promises
articles of great interest to our readers. We present our
subscribers this month with an admirably drawn and engraved
plate of Saukie and Fox Indians “on the look
out.” Also, a beautiful view of a Waterfall in Georgia.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Poems. By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Boston: James
Munroe &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot do justice either to the faults or merits of this
singular volume, in a brief notice. The author has one of
the most peculiar and original minds of which we have
any record in literature, and a thorough analysis of his
powers, even if successful, would occupy a large space.
No reader of Mr. Emerson’s works need be informed that
the poems are full of imagination, fancy, and feeling, and
display a great command of expression. For our own part
we prefer those poems in the volume which are least connected
with the author’s system of ethics and metaphysics,
such as “Each and All,” “The Forerunners,” “The
Humble Bee,” and “The Problem.” In many of the
others there is an evident attempt at versifying opinions;
and the opinions are generally of that kind which readers
will either pronounce unintelligible, or false and pernicious.
“The Sphinx,” “Woodnotes,” “Merlin,” “Initial, Demoniac,
and Celestial Love,” “Blight,” “Threnody,”
and many other pieces, though containing many deep and
delicate imaginations, are chiefly remarkable as embodying
a theory of life, and system of religion, whose peculiarity
consists in inverting the common beliefs and feelings of
mankind. Here and there we perceive traces of the leading
idea contained in that aggregation of fancy, sensibility,
blasphemy, licentiousness, plagiarism, and noble sentiments,
going under the name of “Vestus,”—we mean the idea
that there is no essential difference between evil and good.
Thus, in the “pure realm” to which celestial love mounts,
in Mr. Emerson’s theory of love,</p>

          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>And joy and moan,</p>
<p class='line0'>Melt into one.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Perhaps this opinion is a necessary result of the principles
of pantheism, but it makes as bad poetry as false philosophy.
Indeed, Mr. Emerson’s poems expressive of opinions, are
the harshest in metre, and least poetical in feeling, which
the volume contains; and cannot be compared, in respect
to artistical merit, with the prose statements of the same,
or similar doctrines, in his “Essays.”</p>

Geoffrey Chaucer, by Charles D. Deshler. Spenser and the
Fairy Queen. By Mrs. C. M. Kirkland. New York:
Wiley &amp; Putnam. 2 Parts. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such a work as this deserves an extensive circulation,
and we wish that any advice of ours could impel our
readers to procure it. Here, in a compact and available
form, are some of the finest passages in English poetry.
The selections from Chaucer were evidently a labor of love
to Mr. Deshler, and he has hit upon those portions most
likely to entertain the reader, and awake an affection for
the poet. The life of Chaucer, and the criticism of his mind
and works, is exceedingly genial and truthful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Kirkland has done equal justice to Spenser. Taken
together, these volumes cannot be praised too highly, and
their circulation through the country would do much to
raise the taste of the community. Although these poets
occupy the first rank among English authors, they are
known but imperfectly to the large majority of readers.
The publishers deserve the thanks of the public for issuing
them in a form, at once cheap and elegant, so that the treasures
of thought and imagination they contain can be placed
within the reach of the humblest lovers of poetry.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Modern Standard Drama: A Collection of the most
Popular Acting Plays, with Critical Remarks, &amp;c.
Edited by Epes Sargent. New York: Wm. Taylor &amp; Co.
4 Vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This publication has now run to forty numbers, and promises
to be the best of all the various collections of acting
plays. It is edited by Epes Sargent, Esq., a gentleman
whose knowledge of the stage and of English dramatic
literature is very extensive, and who is himself well known
as a fine poet and successful dramatist. To members of
the profession the collection is invaluable, as it contains
directions regarding stage business, costumes, and other
information of much importance. As a work, also, for the
general reader, it has great merits. It is to contain all the
standard plays produced within the last two centuries, and
also the popular dramas of the present day, including those
of Knowles, Bulwer, and Talfourd. Mr. Sargent introduces
each play with a biographical and critical notice,
referring to the great actors who have won renown in its
principal character, and discussing also its intrinsic merits.
The field of selection is very rich and extensive, and includes
much, in tragedy and in comedy, of which no one can
be ignorant, who pretends to have on acquaintance with the
masterpieces of English genius. Down to the middle of
the last century, a large proportion of the best English
poets were dramatic writers. The theatre was the place
where, in fact, the poet was published. Thousands heard
and saw, who never read. A body of dramatic literature,
therefore, on the comprehensive plan adopted by Mr. Sargeant,
will contain a large number of plays which are part
and parcel of English literature.</p>

By Denison Olmstead, LL. D. New York:

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is one of the best popular works on astronomical
science which we have seen. It is clear in exposition,
familiar in style, and orderly in arrangement. There is,
of course, nothing of the quackery which disgraces many

New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam. 1 Vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sam Lover is a name which would sell this book even if
its merits were below mediocrity. Personally, and as a
writer, he has wrinkled with happy smiles the faces of
thousands. The volume, as might be expected, is brimful
of sentiment and fun, gushing out of a true Irish heart and
brain, and instinct with animation and good feeling. Many
of the songs have been sung by himself, at his “Irish
Evenings,” in the principal cities of the Union. The
book could have no better advertisement than the recollection
of the entertainment they occasioned.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poems of Thomas Campbell. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the best and most complete edition of Campbell
yet issued in the United States. It contains a handsome
portrait, six fine steel engravings, a racy life of the author
from Frazer’s Magazine, the brilliant essay on his genius
and writings contained in Gilfillan’s “Literary Portraits,”
and all of Campbell’s later productions, including the
melancholy rhymes entitled “The Pilgrim of Glencoe.”
In this volume we see Campbell in the dawn, progress,
and sottish decline of his powers—as the author at once
of the most spirit-stirring lyrics and most beautiful romantic
poems, and as the feeble poetaster, mumbling in
his old age a few verses of polished imbecility, hateful to
gods and men. The greater part of the volume, however,
is, in its kind, of first rate excellence, and will live with
the language. We have only to regret that Campbell did
not write more poetry while his genius was in its prime.
What he has written has passed into the hearts and memories
of his countrymen, to a greater extent, perhaps,
than the poetry of any of his contemporaries, even of those
who were his superiors in the range of their genius. Byron,
Scott, and Moore, are the only modern poets who approach
him in popularity. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and <a id='shel'></a>Shelley,
are still the poets of a few, in spite of the endeavors of
publishers and critics to make them poets of the million.
We think each of them superior to Campbell in genius, but
we should despair of ever seeing them his equals in popularity.
One element of his success is the moral character
of his writings, and his sweetness and purity of sentiment;
yet all accounts seem to concur in representing him, personally,
as sottish in his habits, coarse in his conversation,
and not without malice and envy in his disposition. Perhaps
his intemperance was the source of many of his errors;
and his intemperance had its source in laziness. Judging
from the records of his conversation, it is fortunate that
the vices of Campbell’s tongue were not the vices of
his pen.</p>

Graham. Edited by Henry Reed, LL. D. New York:
D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To the student of verbal distinctions this volume will be
an important aid. The author points out the shades of distinction
between apparently synonymous words with an
admirable nicety of criticism. The study of the book will
tend to sharpen the intellect. It is very much better than
the <span class='it'>chatty</span> work of Mrs. Piozzi, and the heavy quarto of Dr.
Crabbe, on the same subject. We note some occasional
blunders, such as the distinction drawn between genius and
talent, and understanding and intellect; but these are but
exceptions to the general rule of correctness. Prof. Reed
has furnished on introduction, and apt illustrative quotations
from Shakspeare, Milton, and Wordsworth.</p>

1 Vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is a fit companion to the “History of the
Thirty Years War,” issued by the same publishers. Both
works are admirable, and place Schiller in a prominent
rank among philosophical historians; but of the two, we
prefer the present. The subject is a noble one, and gives
full exercise to Schiller’s large intellect, and heroic and
humane spirit. The plan of the history is especially excellent,
and we have only to regret that it was never completed.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publishers have issued this masterpiece of wit in a
form similar to their editions of Dante, Tasso, and Campbell.
The edition is enriched with curious and copious
notes, illustrative of Butler’s time, and contains a well
written biography. It is the only good edition of Hudibras
ever published in the United States, and we hope that
thousands who have never enjoyed its perusal, will be
enabled to do it now. The original work contained so
many allusions to the author’s recondite knowledge, and
to the factions and fanaticisms of his day, that it cannot be
read understandingly without some such commentary as
Dr. Nash has supplied. Butler is the wittiest of the English
poets.</p>

Real Examples. By John Frost, LL. D. New York:
D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an entertaining volume, and will be especially
acceptable to the young. It is hardly worthy, however, of
being called “the moral of history,” even that moral which
history should teach the boys and girls. The “do-me-good”
air of the narratives, is strangely at variance with
the essential character of some of the events and actors.
The most superficial student will notice in the volume
many incorrect impressions conveyed of historical personages.
The “moral” of the book is about on a level
with the moral of Weems’s lives of Washington and
Marion.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Eclectic Moral Philosophy. Prepared for Literary Institutions
and General Use. By Rev. J. R. Boyd. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work is principally made up of classified selections
from standard writers on ethics. It, of course, lacks unity,
and therefore can hardly be called a system of philosophy;
but it very well answers the purpose for which it was compiled.
Its merit, as a book for schools and general use,
consists in the stringent application of moral principles to
individual conduct. All those actions and states of mind
which clash with morality, are analyzed with much acuteness,
and set forth with great directness.</p>

By J. Bayard Taylor. New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam.
2 Parts. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>All things considered, we deem this work one of the
most deserving which “Young America” has yet produced.
It is written by a young man just of age, who started for
Europe before he was nineteen, with not more than a hundred
and fifty dollars in his pocket, and for two years
literally walked about Europe. He supported himself by
literature, and at the end of his journey had not expended
more than four hundred dollars. The excellence of the
work comes from its exceeding freshness and spirit. For
every great object of nature and art which the author saw,
he had to suffer some privations; and he accordingly describes
them much better than he would have done had he
possessed the “advantages” of common tourists. Besides,
his mode of traveling made him familiar with the people
of the countries he visited; and he gives many curious
anecdotes of their manners and condition. It is honorable
to human nature, that his impressions of the common
people in England, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, were
of a pleasing character, as he was often placed in relations
to them calculated to draw out their true nature, whether
it were kind or kindless. He was almost uniformly treated
with hospitality, and sometimes even with affection. He
discovered, however, that they were singularly and ridiculously
ignorant of every thing regarding America—its
geography, its government, and its people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one quality in this book which every reader
must feel to be fascinating—we mean the beautiful sweetness
and healthiness of the author’s mind and disposition.
He never brags of the obstacles he <a id='sur'></a>surmounted, nor
whines at the privations he endured, but tells the story of
his journeyings with a most bewitching simplicity and
modesty. Youth, and the bright thoughts and sweet feelings
of youth, are on every page, infusing life into the narrative,
and giving picturesque vigor to the descriptions.
The author must bear a brave, serene, and modest heart
under his jacket; and we cordially wish him and his delightful
book all the success which both so richly merit.</p>

Sketches, Poems, &amp;c. By Miss Emily Chubbuck.
Boston: Wm. D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No reader of “Graham” will need any advice from us
to procure these elegant volumes, as a large portion of
their contents was originally contributed to this Magazine,
and obtained a wide and deserved popularity. We are
glad to see the admirable stories of the authoress thus collected.
They will take an honorable position in the
department of literature to which they belong. Fanny
Forrester, indeed, is one of the most charming of story-tellers.
She has ease, grace, invention, vivacity, a quick
eye for character and manners, and a fine flexible style.
The interest of the book is enhanced by the present position
of the gifted authoress. As Mrs. Judson, she will devote
her fine talents and beautiful enthusiasm of character to a
new object. The present book, therefore, has almost the
look of a posthumous work. We need not ask for it what
it will be sure to obtain—the attention and the good-will
of the reading public.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Literary Studies, a Collection of Miscellaneous Essays.
By W. A. Jones. New York: Edward Walker. 1 Vol.
12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This elegant volume contains thirty-two essays on a wide
variety of subjects connected with literature and life.
They are the production of a gentleman who has made
literature a study, and who always gives in his essays the
results of his own investigations and reflections. The style
is very condensed; the fault of the diction, perhaps, arises
from the <a id='too'></a>too great desire of the author to cram the largest
amount of thought and observation into the smallest possible
space. This unusual peculiarity of style is the ideal of style
when it is combined with mellowness and vitality; but the
sentences of Mr. Jones are often dry and brittle, as well as
condensed. Bating this defect, the volume is deserving of
great praise. In short essays it takes comprehensive views
of wide domains of letters, and is a good guide to the student
of elegant literature. The literary information which it
contains is very large. We will venture to say that no
man in the country can read it without learning something
which he did not know before.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Amy Herbert: a Tale. By Miss Sewell. New York:
D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work has essentially the same characteristics as the
novel of “Gertrude,” by the same authoress. Miss Sewell
is the daughter, we believe, of an English Episcopal
clergyman of the Oxford school. Her tales inculcate the
piety and morality of practical life; deal with ordinary
cares and temptations, expose the moral dangers which
beset every relation of existence, and evince a clear insight
into the heart’s workings, under the pressure of every day
enticements. The thoughtful cheerfulness of her religious
faith diffuses through her stories a certain beautiful repose
which sometimes almost suggests genius. Her books are
of that kind which are calculated to benefit even more than
to please.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Lucretia, or the Children of the Night. By Sir Bulwer
Lytton. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this strange mass of “crimson crimes,” the author of
“Pelham” has fairly rivaled the French school of novelists.
It displays more morbid strength of mind than any
thing which Bulwer has previously written. Though exceedingly
interesting, and evincing much power in the analysis
of the darker passions, it leaves a disagreeable impression.
The tone of the sentiment is not English. The
novel, indeed, exhibits the characteristic qualities of the
author in a form exaggerated almost to caricature. It
reads like a melo-drama. We may refer to it more at
large in our next number.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Use of the Body in Relation to the Mind. By George
Moore, M. D. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 Vol.
12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most important subjects which can engage
human attention is in this work, so treated, that its great
leading facts and principles can be understood by the
common reader. The author has evidently given to each
topic he discusses the most profound attention, and has
produced a work which, if diligently studied by the mass of
people, is calculated to remove a vast sum of that misery
which springs from ignorance.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A work like the present has long been wanted, and we
are glad that an American house has had the enterprise to
undertake it. In no other volume, with which we are
acquainted, can the reader obtain so comprehensive a view
of the poetry of the Ancients. Mr. Peter’s biographical
notices are excellent. He has made selections from nearly
two hundred authors—a work of vast labor performed
with great skill and taste.</p>

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
